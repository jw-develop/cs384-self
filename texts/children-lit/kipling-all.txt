The weather door of the smoking-room had been left open to the North
Atlantic fog, as the big liner rolled and lifted, whistling to warn the
fishing-fleet.

"That Cheyne boy's the biggest nuisance aboard," said a man in a frieze
overcoat, shutting the door with a bang. "He isn't wanted here. He's
too fresh."

A white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between
bites: "I know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I dell you you
should imbort ropes' ends free under your dariff."

"Pshaw! There isn't any real harm to him. He's more to be pitied than
anything," a man from New York drawled, as he lay at full length along
the cushions under the wet skylight. "They've dragged him around from
hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid. I was talking to his mother
this morning. She's a lovely lady, but she don't pretend to manage him.
He's going to Europe to finish his education."

"Education isn't begun yet." This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a
corner. "That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he told me. He
isn't sixteen either."

"Railroads, his father, aind't it?" said the German.

"Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San
Diego, the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen
railroads, half the lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his wife
spend the money," the Philadelphian went on lazily. "The West don't
suit her, she says. She just tracks around with the boy and her nerves,
trying to find out what'll amuse him, I guess. Florida, Adirondacks,
Lakewood, Hot Springs, New York, and round again. He isn't much more
than a second-hand hotel clerk now. When he's finished in Europe he'll
be a holy terror."

"What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?" said
a voice from the frieze ulster.

"Old man's piling up the rocks. 'Don't want to be disturbed, I guess.
He'll find out his error a few years from now. 'Pity, because there's a
heap of good in the boy if you could get at it."

"Mit a rope's end; mit a rope's end!" growled the German.

Once more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen
years old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his
mouth, leaned in over the high footway. His pasty yellow complexion did
not show well on a person of his years, and his look was a mixture of
irresolution, bravado, and very cheap smartness. He was dressed in a
cherry-coloured blazer, knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle
shoes, with a red flannel cap at the back of the head. After whistling
between his teeth, as he eyed the company, he said in a loud, high
voice: "Say, it's thick outside. You can hear the fish-boats squawking
all around us. Say, wouldn't it be great if we ran down one?"

"Shut the door, Harvey," said the New Yorker. "Shut the door and stay
outside. You're not wanted here."

"Who'll stop me?" he answered deliberately. "Did you pay for my
passage, Mister Martin? 'Guess I've as good right here as the next man."

He picked up some dice from a checker-board and began throwing, right
hand against left.

"Say, gen'elmen, this is deader'n mud. Can't we make a game of poker
between us?"

There was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, swung his legs, and
drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he pulled out a
roll of bills as if to count them.

"How's your mamma this afternoon?" a man said. "I didn't see her at
lunch."

"In her state-room, I guess. She's 'most always sick on the ocean. I'm
going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her. I
don't go down more 'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass
that butler's-pantry place. Say, this is the first time I've been on
the ocean."

"Oh, don't apologise, Harvey."

"Who's apologising? This is the first time I've crossed the ocean,
gen'elmen, and, except the first day, I haven't been sick one little
bit. No, sir!" He brought down his fist with a triumphant bang, wetted
his finger, and went on counting the bills.

"Oh, you're a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight," the
Philadelphian yawned. "You'll blossom into a credit to your country if
you don't take care."

"I know it. I'm an American--first, last, and all the time. I'll show
'em that when I strike Europe. Pif! My cig's out. I can't smoke the
truck the steward sells. Any gen'elman got a real Turkish cig on him?"

The chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. "Say,
Mac," cried Harvey, cheerfully, "how are we hitting it?"

"Vara much in the ordinary way," was the grave reply. "The young are as
polite as ever to their elders, an' their elders are e'en tryin' to
appreciate it."

A low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his cigar-case and
handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey.

"Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt," he said. "You
vill dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy."

Harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he felt that he was
getting on in grown-up society.

"It would take more 'n this to keel me over," he said, ignorant that he
was lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling 'stogie'.

"Dot we shall bresently see," said the German. "Where are we now, Mr.
Mactonal'?"

 "Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer," said the engineer.
"We'll be on the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o' speakin',
we're all among the fishing-fleet now. We've shaved three dories an'
near skelped the boom off a Frenchman since noon, an' that's close
sailin', ye may say."

"You like my cigar, eh?" the German asked, for Harvey's eyes were full
of tears.

"Fine, full flavour," he answered through shut teeth. "Guess we've
slowed down a little, haven't we? I'll skip out and see what the log
says."

"I might if I vhas you," said the German.

Harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He was very
unhappy; but he saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and,
since he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick, his
pride made him go aft to the second-saloon deck at the stern, which was
finished in a turtle-back. The deck was deserted, and he crawled to the
extreme end of it, near the flagpole. There he doubled up in limp
agony, for the Wheeling "stogie" joined with the surge and jar of the
screw to sieve out his soul. His head swelled; sparks of fire danced
before his eyes; his body seemed to lose weight, while his heels
wavered in the breeze. He was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of
the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the
turtle-back. Then a low, grey mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked
Harvey under one arm, so to speak, and pulled him off and away to
leeward; the great green closed over him, and he went quietly to sleep.

He was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow
at a summer-school he had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he
remembered that he was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean,
but was too weak to fit things together. A new smell filled his
nostrils; wet and clammy chills ran down his back, and he was
helplessly full of salt water. When he opened his eyes, he perceived
that he was still on the top of the sea, for it was running round him
in silver-coloured hills, and he was lying on a pile of half-dead fish,
looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey.

"It's no good," thought the boy. "I'm dead, sure enough, and this thing
is in charge."

He groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little
gold rings half hidden in curly black hair.

"Aha! You feel some pretty well now'?" it said. "Lie still so: we trim
better."

With a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless
sea that lifted her twenty full feet, only to slide her into a glassy
pit beyond. But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey's
talk. "Fine good job, I say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at? Better good
job, I say, your boat not catch me. How you come to fall out?"

"I was sick," said Harvey; "sick, and couldn't help it."

"Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she yaw a little. Then I
see you come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by
the screw, but you dreeft--dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you.
So you shall not die this time."

"Where am I?" said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly
safe where he lay.

"You are with me in the dory--Manuel my name, and I come from schooner
'We're Here' of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester. By-and-by we get
supper. Eh, wha-at?"

He seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not
content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up
to it, swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a
grinding, thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this
entertainment lasted, Harvey could not remember, for he lay back
terrified at the sight of the smoking swells. He fancied he heard a gun
and a horn and shouting. Something bigger than the dory, but quite as
lively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at once; he was dropped
into a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink
and took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.

When he waked he listened for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer,
wondering why his stateroom had grown so small. Turning, he looked into
a narrow, triangular cave, lit by a lamp hung against a huge square
beam. A three-cornered table within arm's reach ran from the angle of
the bows to the foremast. At the after end, behind a well-used Plymouth
stove, sat a boy about his own age, with a flat red face and a pair of
twinkling grey eyes. He was dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber
boots. Several pairs of the same sort of foot-wear, an old cap, and
some worn-out woolen socks lay on the floor, and black and yellow
oilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks. The place was packed as
full of smells as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly
thick flavour of their own which made a sort of background to the
smells of fried fish, burnt grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco;
but these, again, were all hooped together by one encircling smell of
ship and salt water. Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets
on his bed-place. He was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of
lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion was not that of a
steamer. She was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather wriggling
herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a
halter. Water-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams creaked and
whined about him. All these things made him grunt despairingly and
think of his mother.

"Feelin' better?" said the boy, with a grin. "Hev some coffee?" He
brought a tin cup full, and sweetened it with molasses.

"Is n't there milk?" said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of
bunks as if he expected to find a cow there.

"Well, no," said the boy. "Ner there ain't likely to be till 'baout
mid-September. 'Tain't bad coffee. I made it."

Harvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces
of crisp fried pork, which he ate ravenously.

"I've dried your clothes. Guess they've shrunk some," said the boy.
"They ain't our style much--none of 'em. Twist round an' see ef you're
hurt any."

Harvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any
injuries.

"That's good," the boy said heartily. "Fix yerself an' go on deck. Dad
wants to see you. I'm his son,--Dan, they call me,--an' I'm cook's
helper an' everything else aboard that's too dirty for the men. There
ain't no boy here 'cep' me sence Otto went overboard--an' he was only a
Dutchy, an' twenty year old at that. How'd you come to fall off in a
dead flat ca'am?"

"'Twasn't a calm," said Harvey, sulkily. "It was a gale, and I was
seasick. Guess I must have rolled over the rail."

"There was a little common swell yes'day an' last night," said the boy.
"But ef thet's your notion of a gale----" He whistled. "You'll know
more 'fore you're through. Hurry! Dad's waitin'."

Like many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his
life received a direct order--never, at least, without long, and
sometimes tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the
reasons for the request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his
spirit, which, perhaps, was the reason that she herself walked on the
edge of nervous prostration. He could not see why he should be expected
to hurry for any man's pleasure, and said so. "Your dad can come down
here if he's so anxious to talk to me. I want him to take me to New
York right away. It'll pay him."

Dan opened his eyes, as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him.
"Say, dad!" he shouted up the fo'c'sle hatch, "he says you kin slip
down an' see him ef you're anxious that way. 'Hear, dad?"

The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a
human chest: "Quit foolin', Dan, and send him to me."

Dan sniggered, and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes. There was
something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his
extreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually
unfolding the tale of his own and his father's wealth on the voyage
home. This rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for
life. He hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder, and
stumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to where a small,
thick-set, clean-shaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step that led
up to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving a
long, oily sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen
fishing-boats. Between them lay little black specks, showing where the
dories were out fishing. The schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on
the mainmast, played easily at anchor, and except for the man by the
cabin-roof--"house" they call it--she was deserted.

"Mornin'--good afternoon, I should say. You've nigh slep' the clock
around, young feller," was the greeting.

"Mornin'," said Harvey. He did not like being called "young feller";
and, as one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His mother
suffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet; but this mariner did not
seem excited.

"Naow let's hear all abaout it. It's quite providential, first an'
last, fer all concerned. What might be your name? Where from (we
mistrust it's Noo York), an' where baound (we mistrust it's Europe)?"

Harvey gave his name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of
the accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to
New York, where his father would pay anything any one chose to name.

"H'm," said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey's
speech. "I can't say we think special of any man, or boy even, that
falls overboard from that kind o' packet in a flat ca'am. Least of all
when his excuse is thet he's seasick."

"Excuse!" cried Harvey. "D'you suppose I'd fall overboard into your
dirty little boat for fun?"

"Not knowin' what your notions o' fun may be, I can't rightly say,
young feller. But if I was you, I wouldn't call the boat which, under
Providence, was the means o' savin' ye, names. In the first place, it's
blame irreligious. In the second, it's annoyin' to my feelin's--an' I'm
Disko Troop o' the "We're Here" o' Gloucester, which you don't seem
rightly to know."

"I don't know and I don't care," said Harvey. "I'm grateful enough for
being saved and all that, of course; but I want you to understand that
the sooner you take me back to New York the better it'll pay you."

"Meanin'--haow?" Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously
mild blue eye.

"Dollars and cents," said Harvey, delighted to think that he was making
an impression. "Cold dollars and cents." He thrust a hand into a
pocket, and threw out his stomach a little, which was his way of being
grand. "You've done the best day's work you ever did in your life when
you pulled me in. I'm all the son Harvey Cheyne has."

"He's bin favoured," said Disko, drily.

"And if you don't know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don't know
much--that's all. Now turn her around and let's hurry."

Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with
people discussing and envying his father's dollars.

"Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't. Take a reef in your stummick, young
feller. It's full o' my vittles."

Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the
stump-foremast, and the blood rushed to his face. "We'll pay for that
too," he said. "When do you suppose we shall get to New York?"

"I don't use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point about
September; an' your pa--I'm real sorry I hain't heerd tell of him--may
give me ten dollars efter all your talk. Then o' course he mayn't."

"Ten dollars! Why, see here, I--" Harvey dived into his pocket for the
wad of bills. All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.

"Not lawful currency, an' bad for the lungs. Heave 'em overboard, young
feller, and try ag'in."

"It's been stolen!" cried Harvey, hotly.

"You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?"

"A hundred and thirty-four dollars--all stolen," said Harvey, hunting
wildly through his pockets. "Give them back."

A curious change flitted across old Troop's hard face. "What might you
have been doin' at your time o' life with one hundred an' thirty-four
dollars, young feller?"

"It was part of my pocket-money--for a month." This Harvey thought
would be a knockdown blow, and it was--indirectly.

Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his
pocket-money--for one month only! You don't remember hittin' anything
when you fell over, do you? Crack ag'in' a stanchion, le's say. Old man
Hasken o' the "East Wind"--Troop seemed to be talking to himself--"he
tripped on a hatch an' butted the mainmast with his head--hardish.
'Baout three weeks afterwards, old man Hasken he would hev it that the
"East Wind" was a commerce-destroyin' man-o'-war, an' so he declared
war on Sable Island because it was Bridish, an' the shoals run aout too
far. They sewed him up in a bed-bag, his head an' feet appearin', fer
the rest o' the trip, an' now he's to home in Essex playin' with little
rag dolls."

Harvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: "We're sorry
fer you. We're very sorry fer you--an' so young. We won't say no more
abaout the money, I guess."

"'Course you won't. You stole it."

"Suit yourself. We stole it ef it's any comfort to you. Naow, abaout
goin' back. Allowin' we could do it, which we can't, you ain't in no
fit state to go back to your home, an' we've jest come on to the Banks,
workin' fer our bread. We don't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a
month, let alone pocket-money; an' with good luck we'll be ashore again
somewheres abaout the first weeks o' September."

"But--but it's May now, and I can't stay here doin' nothing just
because you want to fish. I can't, I tell you!"

"Right an' jest; jest an' right. No one asks you to do nothin'. There's
a heap as you can do, for Otto he went overboard on Le Have. I mistrust
he lost his grip in a gale we f'und there. Anyways, he never come back
to deny it. You've turned up, plain, plumb providential for all
concerned. I mistrust, though, there's ruther few things you kin do.
Ain't thet so?"

"I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore," said
Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about "piracy," at
which Troop almost--not quite--smiled.

"Excep' talk. I'd forgot that. You ain't asked to talk more'n you've a
mind to aboard the "We're Here". Keep your eyes open, an' help Dan to
do ez he's bid, an' sechlike, an' I'll give you--you ain't wuth it, but
I'll give--ten an' a ha'af a month; say thirty-five at the end o' the
trip. A little work will ease up your head, an' you kin tell us all
abaout your dad an' your ma n' your money efterwards."

"She's on the steamer," said Harvey, his eyes fill-with tears. "Take me
to New York at once."

"Poor woman--poor woman! When she has you back she'll forgit it all,
though. There's eight of us on the "We're Here", an' ef we went back
naow--it's more'n a thousand mile--we'd lose the season. The men they
wouldn't hev it, allowin' I was agreeable."

"But my father would make it all right."

"He'd try. I don't doubt he'd try," said Troop; "but a whole season's
catch is eight men's bread; an' you'll be better in your health when
you see him in the fall. Go forward an' help Dan. It's ten an' a ha'af
a month, ez I said, an', o' course, all f'und, same ez the rest o' us."

"Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?" said Harvey.

"An' other things. You've no call to shout, young feller."

"I won't! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little
fish-kettle"--Harvey stamped on the deck--"ten times over, if you take
me to New York safe; and--and--you're in a hundred and thirty by me,
anyway."

"Ha-ow?" said Troop, the iron face darkening.

"How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do
menial work"--Harvey was very proud of that adjective--"till the Fall.
I tell you I will not. You hear?"

Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while,
as Harvey harangued fiercely all around him.

"Hsh!" he said at last. "I'm figurin' out my responsibilities in my own
mind. It's a matter o' jedgment."

Dan Stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow. "Don't go to tamperin'
with dad any more," he pleaded. "You've called him a thief two or three
times over, an' he don't take that from any livin' bein'."

"I won't!" Harvey almost shrieked, disregarding the advice; and still
Troop meditated.

"Seems kinder unneighbourly," he said at last, his eye travelling down
to Harvey. "I don't blame you, not a mite, young feller, nor you won't
blame me when the bile's out o' your systim. 'Be sure you sense what I
say? Ten an' a ha'af fer second boy on the schooner--an' all f'und--fer
to teach you an' fer the sake o' your health. Yes or no?"

"No!" said Harvey. "Take me back to New York or I'll see you--"

He did not exactly remember what followed. He was lying in the
scuppers, holding on to a nose that bled, while Troop looked down on
him serenely.

"Dan," he said to his son, "I was sot ag'in' this young feller when I
first saw him, on account o' hasty jedgments. Never you be led astray
by hasty jedgments, Dan. Naow I'm sorry for him, because he's clear
distracted in his upper works. He ain't responsible fer the names he's
give me, nor fer his other statements nor fer jumpin' overboard, which
I'm abaout ha'af convinced he did. You be gentle with him, Dan, 'r I'll
give you twice what I've give him. Them hemmeridges clears the head.
Let him sluice it off!"

Troop went down solemnly into the cabin, where he and the older men
bunked, leaving Dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions.



CHAPTER II

"I warned ye," said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark,
oiled planking. "Dad ain't noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw!
there's no sense takin' on so." Harvey's shoulders were rising and
falling in spasms of dry sobbing. "I know the feelin'. First time dad
laid me out was the last--and that was my first trip. Makes ye feel
sickish an' lonesome. I know."

"It does," moaned Harvey. "That man's either crazy or drunk, and--and I
can't do anything."

"Don't say that to dad," whispered Dan. "He's set ag'in' all liquor,
an'--well, he told me you was the madman. What in creation made you
call him a thief? He's my dad."

Harvey sat up, mopped his nose, and told the story of the missing wad
of bills. "I'm not crazy," he wound up. "Only--your father has never
seen more than a five-dollar bill at a time, and my father could buy up
this boat once a week and never miss it."

"You don't know what the "We're Here's" worth. Your dad must hey a pile
o' money. How did he git it? Dad sez loonies can't shake out a straight
yarn. Go ahead."

"In gold-mines and things, West."

"I've read o' that kind o' business. Out West, too? Does he go around
with a pistol on a trick-pony, same ez the circus? They call that the
Wild West, and I've heard that their spurs an' bridles was solid
silver."

"You are a chump!" said Harvey, amused in spite of himself. "My father
hasn't any use for ponies. When he wants to ride he takes his car."

"Haow? Lobster-car?"

"No. His own private car, of course. You've seen a private car some
time in your life?"

"Slatin Beeman he hez one," said Dan, cautiously. "I saw her at the
Union Depot in Boston, with three niggers hoggin' her run." (Dan meant
cleaning the windows.) "But Slatin Beeman he owns 'baout every railroad
on Long Island, they say; an' they say he's bought 'baout ha'af Noo
Hampshire an' run a line-fence around her, an' filled her up with lions
an' tigers an' bears an' buffalo an' crocodiles an' such all. Slatin
Beeman he's a millionaire. I've seen his car. Yes?"

"Well, my father's what they call a multi-millionaire; and he has two
private cars. One's named for me, the 'Harvey,' and one for my mother,
the 'Constance.'"

"Hold on," said Dan. "Dad don't ever let me swear, but I guess you can.
'Fore we go ahead, I want you to say hope you may die if you're lying."

"Of course," said Harvey.

"Thet ain't 'nuff. Say, 'Hope I may die if I ain't speakin' truth.'"

"Hope I may die right here," said Harvey, "if every word I've spoken
isn't the cold truth."

"Hundred an' thirty-four dollars an' all?" said Dan. "I heard ye
talkin' to dad, an' I ha'af looked you'd be swallered up, same's Jonah."

Harvey protested himself red in the face. Dan was a shrewd young person
along his own lines, and ten minutes' questioning convinced him that
Harvey was not lying--much. Besides, he had bound himself by the most
terrible oath known to boyhood, and yet he sat, alive, with a red-ended
nose, in the scuppers, recounting marvels upon marvels.

"Gosh!" said Dan at last, from the very bottom of his soul, when Harvey
had completed an inventory of the car named in his honour. Then a grin
of mischievous delight overspread his broad face. "I believe you,
Harvey. Dad's made a mistake fer once in his life."

"He has, sure," said Harvey, who was meditating an early revenge.

"He'll be mad clear through. Dad jest hates to be mistook in his
jedgments." Dan lay back and slapped his thigh. "Oh, Harvey, don't you
spile the catch by lettin' on."

"I don't want to be knocked down again. I'll get even with him, though."

"Never heard any man ever got even with dad. But he'd knock ye down
again sure. The more he was mistook the more he'd do it. But gold-mines
and pistols--"

"I never said a word about pistols," Harvey cut in, for he was on his
oath.

"Thet's so; no more you did. Two private cars, then, one named fer you
an' one fer her; an' two hundred dollars a month pocket-money, all
knocked into the scuppers fer not workin' fer ten an' a ha'af a month!
It's the top haul o' the season." He exploded with noiseless chuckles.

"Then I was right? "said Harvey, who thought he had found a sympathiser.

"You was wrong; the wrongest kind o' wrong! You take right hold an'
pitch in 'longside o' me, or you'll catch it, an' I'll catch it fer
backin' you up. Dad always gives me double helps 'cause I'm his son,
an' he hates favourin' folk. 'Guess you're kinder mad at dad. I've been
that way time an' again. But dad's a mighty jest man; all the fleet
says so."

"Looks like justice, this, don't it?" Harvey pointed to his outraged
nose.

"Thet's nothin'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer
health. Say, though, I can't have dealin's with a man that thinks me or
dad or any one on the "We're Here's" a thief.  We ain't any common
wharf-end crowd by any manner o' means. We're fishermen, an' we've
shipped together for six years an' more. Don't you make any mistake on
that! I told ye dad don't let me swear. He calls 'em vain oaths, and
pounds me; but ef I could say what you said 'baout your pap an' his
fixin's, I'd say that 'baout your dollars. I dunno what was in your
pockets when I dried your kit, fer I didn't look to see; but I'd say,
using the very same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad--an'
we was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboard--knows
anythin' 'baout the money. Thet's my say. Naow?"

The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey's brain, and maybe the
loneliness of the sea had something to do with it. "That's all right,"
he said. Then he looked down confusedly. "'Seems to me that for a
fellow just saved from drowning I haven't been over and above grateful,
Dan."

"Well, you was shook up and silly," said Dan. "Anyway, there was only
dad an' me aboard to see it. The cook he don't count."

"I might have thought about losing the bills that way," Harvey said,
half to himself, "instead of calling everybody in sight a thief Where's
your father?"

"In the cabin What d' you want o' him again?"

"You'll see," said Harvey, and he stepped, rather groggily, for his
head was still singing, to the cabin steps, where the little
ship's clock hung in plain sight of the wheel. Troop, in the
chocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy with a note-book and an
enormous black pencil, which he sucked hard from time to time.

"I haven't acted quite right," said Harvey, surprised at his own
meekness.

"What's wrong naow?" said the skipper "Walked into Dan, hev ye?"

"No; it's about you."

"I'm here to listen."

"Well, I--I'm here to take things back," said Harvey, very quickly.
"When a man's saved from drowning--" he gulped.

"Ey? You'll make a man yet ef you go on this way."

"He oughtn't begin by calling people names."

"Jest an' right--right an' jest," said Troop, with the ghost of a dry
smile.

"So I'm here to say I'm sorry." Another big gulp.

Troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held
out an eleven-inch hand. "I mistrusted 'twould do you sights o' good;
an' this shows I weren't mistook in my jedgments." A smothered chuckle
on deck caught his ear. "I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments." The
eleven-inch hand closed on Harvey's, numbing it to the elbow. "We'll
put a little more gristle to that 'fore we've done with you, young
feller; an' I don't think any worse of ye fer anythin' thet's gone by.
You wasn't fairly responsible. Go right abaout your business an' you
won't take no hurt."

"You're white," said Dan, as Harvey regained the deck, flushed to the
tips of his ears.

"I don't feel it," said he.

"I didn't mean that way. I heard what dad said. When dad allows he
don't think the worse of any man, dad's give himself away. He hates to
be mistook in his jedgments, too. Ho! ho! Onct dad has a jedgment, he'd
sooner dip his colours to the British than change it. I'm glad it's
settled right eend up. Dad's right when he says he can't take you back.
It's all the livin' we make here--fishin'. The men'll be back like
sharks after a dead whale in ha'af an hour."

"What for?" said Harvey. "Supper, o' course. Don't your stummick tell
you? You've a heap to learn."

"'Guess I have," said Harvey, dolefully, looking at the tangle of ropes
and blocks overhead.

"She's a daisy," said Dan, enthusiastically, misunderstanding the look.
"Wait till our mainsail's bent, an' she walks home with all her salt
wet. There's some work first, though." He pointed down into the
darkness of the open main-hatch between the two masts.

"What's that for? It's all empty," said Harvey.

"You an' me an' a few more hev got to fill it," said Dan. "That's where
the fish goes."

"Alive?" said Harvey.

"Well, no. They're so's to be ruther dead--an' flat--an' salt. There's
a hundred hogshead o' salt in the bins; an' we hain't more'n covered
our dunnage to now."

"Where are the fish, though?"

"'In the sea, they say; in the boats, we pray,'" said Dan, quoting a
fisherman's proverb. "You come in last night with 'baout forty of 'em."

He pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter-deck.

"You an' me we'll sluice that out when they're through. 'Send we'll hev
full pens to-night! I've seen her down ha'af a foot with fish waitin'
to clean, an' we stood to the tables till we was splittin' ourselves
instid o' them, we was so sleepy. Yes, they're comin' in naow." Dan
looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them
over the shining, silky sea.

"I've never seen the sea from so low down," said Harvey. "It's fine."

The low sun made the water all purple and pinkish, with golden lights
on the barrels of the long swells, and blue and green mackerel shades
in the hollows. Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories
towards her by invisible strings, and the little black figures in the
tiny boats pulled like clockwork toys.

"They've struck on good," said Dan, between his half-shut eyes. "Manuel
hain't room fer another fish. Low ez a lily-pad in still water, ain't
he?"

"Which is Manuel? I don't see how you can tell 'em 'way off, as you do."

"Last boat to the south'ard. He f'und you last night," said Dan,
pointing. "Manuel rows Portugoosey; ye can't mistake him. East o'
him--he's a heap better'n he rows--is Pennsylvania. Loaded with
saleratus, by the looks of him. East o' him--see how pretty they string
out all along with the humpy shoulders, is Long Jack. He's a Galway man
inhabitin' South Boston, where they all live mostly, an' mostly them
Galway men are good in a boat. North, away yonder--you'll hear him tune
up in a minute--is Tom Platt. Man-o'-war's man he was on the old
Ohio--first of our navy, he says, to go araound the Horn. He never
talks of much else, 'cept when he sings, but he has fair fishin' luck.
There! What did I tell you?"

A melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory.
Harvey heard something about somebody's hands and feet being cold, and
then:

  "Bring forth the chart, the doleful chart;
  See where them mountings meet!
  The clouds are thick around their heads,
  The mists around their feet."


"Full boat," said Dan, with a chuckle. "If he gives us 'O Captain' it's
toppin' full."

The bellow continued:

  "And naow to thee, O Capting,
  Most earnestly I pray
  That they shall never bury me
  In church or cloister grey."

"Double game for Tom Platt. He'll tell you all about the old Ohio
to-morrow. 'See that blue dory behind him? He's my uncle,--dad's own
brother,--an' ef there's any bad luck loose on the Banks she'll fetch
up ag'in' Uncle Salters, sure. Look how tender he's rowin'. I'll lay my
wage and share he's the only man stung up to-day--an' he's stung up
good."

"What'll sting him?" said Harvey, getting interested.

"Strawberries, mostly. Punkins, sometimes, an' sometimes lemons an'
cucumbers. Yes, he's stung up from his elbows down. That man's luck's
perfectly paralysin'. Naow we'll take a-holt o' the tackles an' h'ist
'em in. Is it true, what you told me jest now, that you never done a
hand's turn o' work in all your born life? Must feel kinder awful,
don't it?"

"I'm going to try to work, anyway," Harvey replied stoutly. "Only it's
all dead new."

"Lay a-holt o' that tackle, then. Behind ye!"

Harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the
stays of the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from
something he called a "topping-lift," as Manuel drew alongside in his
loaded dory. The Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey
learned to know well later, and a short-handled fork began to throw
fish into the pen on deck. "Two hundred and thirty-one," he shouted.

"Give him the hook," said Dan, and Harvey ran it into Manuel's hands.
He slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory's bow, caught Dan's
tackle, hooked it to the stern-becket, and clambered into the schooner.

"Pull!" shouted Dan; and Harvey pulled, astonished to find how easily
the dory rose.

"Hold on; she don't nest in the crosstrees!" Dan laughed; and Harvey
held on, for the boat lay in the air above his head.

"Lower away," Dan shouted; and as Harvey lowered, Dan swayed the light
boat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast.
"They don't weigh nothin' empty. Thet was right smart fer a passenger.
There's more trick to it in a sea-way."

"Ah ha!" said Manuel, holding out a brown hand. "You are some pretty
well now? This time last night the fish they fish for you. Now you fish
for fish. Eh, wha-at?"

"I'm--I'm ever so grateful," Harvey stammered, and his unfortunate hand
stole to his pocket once more, but he remembered that he had no money
to offer. When he knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he
might have made would cover him with hot, uneasy blushes in his bunk.

"There is no to be thankful for to me!" said Manuel. "How shall I leave
you dreeft, dreeft all around the Banks? Now you are a fisherman eh,
wha-at? Ouh! Auh!" He bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips
to get the kinks out of himself.

"I have not cleaned boat to-day. Too busy. They struck on queek. Danny,
my son, clean for me."

Harvey moved forward at once. Here was something he could do for the
man who had saved his life.

Dan threw him a swab, and he leaned over the dory, mopping up the slime
clumsily, but with great good-will. "Hike out the foot-boards; they
slide in them grooves," said Dan. "Swab 'em an' lay 'em down. Never let
a foot-board jam. Ye may want her bad some day. Here's Long Jack."

A stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside.

"Manuel, you take the tackle. I'll fix the tables. Harvey, clear
Manuel's boat. Long Jack's nestin' on the top of her."

Harvey looked up from his swabbing at the bottom of another dory just
above his head.

"Jest like the Injian puzzle-boxes, ain't they?" said Dan, as the one
boat dropped into the other.

"Takes to ut like a duck to water," said Long Jack, a grizzly-chinned,
long-lipped Galway man, bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done.
Disko in the cabin growled up the hatchway, and they could hear him
suck his pencil.

"Wan hunder an' forty-nine an' a half--bad luck to ye, Discobolus!"
said Long Jack. "I'm murderin' meself to fill your pockuts. Slate ut
for a bad catch. The Portugee has bate me."

Whack came another dory alongside, and more fish shot into the pen.

"Two hundred and three. Let's look at the passenger!" The speaker was
even larger than the Galway man, and his face was made curious by a
purple cut running slantways from his left eye to the right corner of
his mouth.

Not knowing what else to do, Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down,
pulled out the foot-boards, and laid them in the bottom of the boat.

"He's caught on good," said the scarred man, who was Tom Platt,
watching him critically. "There are two ways o' doin' everything. One's
fisher-fashion--any end first an' a slippery hitch over all--an' the
other's--"

"What we did on the old Ohio!" Dan interrupted, brushing into the knot
of men with a long board on legs. "Git out o' here, Tom Platt, an'
leave me fix the tables."

He jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks, kicked
out the leg, and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the
man-o'-war's man.

"An' they did that on the Ohio, too, Danny. See?" said Tom Platt,
laughing.

"'Guess they was swivel-eyed, then, fer it didn't git home, and I know
who'll find his boots on the main-truck ef he don't leave us alone.
Haul ahead! I'm busy, can't ye see?"

"Danny, ye lie on the cable an' sleep all day," said Long Jack. "You're
the hoight av impidence, an' I'm persuaded ye'll corrupt our supercargo
in a week."

"His name's Harvey," said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, "an'
he'll be worth five of any Sou' Boston clam-digger 'fore long." He laid
the knives tastefully on the table, cocked his head on one side, and
admired the effect.

"I think it's forty-two," said a small voice over-side, and there was a
roar of laughter as another voice answered, "Then my luck's turned fer
onct, 'caze I'm forty-five, though I be stung outer all shape."

"Forty-two or forty-five. I've lost count," the small voice said.

"It's Penn an' Uncle Salters caountin' catch. This beats the circus any
day," said Dan. "Jest look at 'em!"

"Come in--come in!" roared Long Jack. "It's wet out yondher, children."

"Forty-two, ye said." This was Uncle Salters.

"I'll count again, then," the voice replied meekly.

The two dories swung together and bunted into the schooner's side.

"Patience o' Jerusalem!" snapped Uncle Salters, backing water with a
splash. "What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me.
You've nigh stove me all up."

"I am sorry, Mr. Salters. I came to sea on account of nervous
dyspepsia. You advised me, I think."

"You an' your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whale-hole," roared
Uncle Salters, a fat and tubly little man. "You're comin' down on me
ag'in. Did ye say forty-two or forty-five?"

"I've forgotten, Mr. Salters. Let's count."

"Don't see as it could be forty-five. I'm forty-five," said Uncle
Salters. "You count keerful, Penn."

Disko Troop came out of the cabin. "Salters, you pitch your fish in
naow at once," he said in the tone of authority.

"Don't spile the catch, dad," Dan murmured. "Them two are on'y jest
beginnin'."

"Mother av delight! He's forkin' them wan by wan," howled Long Jack, as
Uncle Salters got to work laboriously; the little man in the other dory
counting a line of notches on the gunwale.

"That was last week's catch," he said, looking up plaintively, his
forefinger where he had left off.

Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far
overside, slipped the hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her fast
forward. The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in--man, fish,
and all.

"One, two, four--nine," said Tom Platt, counting with a practised eye.
"Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!" Dan let the after-tackle run, and slid
him out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish.

"Hold on!" roared Uncle Salters, bobbing by the waist. "Hold on, I'm a
bit mixed in my caount."

He had no time to protest, but was hove inboard and treated like
"Pennsylvania."

"Forty-one," said Tom Platt. "Beat by a farmer, Salters. An' you sech a
sailor, too!"

"'Tweren't fair caount," said he, stumbling out of the pen; "an' I'm
stung up all to pieces."

His thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white.

"Some folks will find strawberry-bottom," said Dan, addressing the
newly risen moon, "ef they hev to dive fer it, seems to me."

"An' others," said Uncle Salters, "eats the fat o' the land in sloth,
an' mocks their own blood-kin."

"Seat ye! Seat ye!" a voice Harvey had not heard called from the
fo'c'sle. Disko Troop, Tom Platt, Long Jack, and Salters went forward
on the word. Little Penn bent above his square deep-sea reel and the
tangled cod-lines; Manuel lay down full length on the deck, and Dan
dropped into the hold, where Harvey heard him banging casks with a
hammer.

"Salt," he said, returning. "Soon as we're through supper we git to
dressing-down. You'll pitch to dad. Tom Platt an' dad they stow
together, an' you'll hear 'em arguin'. We're second ha'af, you an' me
an' Manuel an' Penn--the youth an' beauty o' the boat."

"What's the good of that?" said Harvey. "I'm hungry."

"They'll be through in a minute. Sniff! She smells good to-night. Dad
ships a good cook ef he do suffer with his brother. It's a full catch
today, ain't it?" He pointed at the pens piled high with cod. "What
water did ye hev, Manuel?"

"Twenty-fife father," said the Portuguese, sleepily. "They strike on
good an' queek. Some day I show you, Harvey."

The moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men
came aft. The cook had no need to cry "second half." Dan and Manuel
were down the hatch and at table ere Tom Platt, last and most
deliberate of the elders, had finished wiping his mouth with the back
of his hand. Harvey followed Penn, and sat down before a tin pan of
cod's tongues and sounds, mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato, a
loaf of hot bread, and some black and powerful coffee. Hungry as they
were, they waited while "Pennsylvania" solemnly asked a blessing. Then
they stoked in silence till Dan drew breath over his tin cup and
demanded of Harvey how he felt.

"'Most full, but there's just room for another piece."

The cook was a huge, jet-black negro, and, unlike all the negroes
Harvey had met, did not talk, contenting himself with smiles and
dumb-show invitations to eat more.

"See, Harvey," said Dan, rapping with his fork on the table, "it's jest
as I said. The young an' handsome men--like me an' Pennsy an' you an'
Manuel--we 're second ha'af, an' we eats when the first ha'af are
through. They're the old fish; and they're mean an' humpy, an' their
stummicks has to be humoured; so they come first, which they don't
deserve. Ain't that so, doctor?"

The cook nodded.

"Can't he talk?" said Harvey, in a whisper.

"'Nough to git along. Not much o' anything we know. His natural
tongue's kinder curious. Comes from the in'ards of Cape Breton, he
does, where the farmers speak home-made Scotch. Cape Breton's full o'
niggers whose folk run in there durin' aour war, an' they talk like the
farmers--all huffy-chuffy."

"That is not Scotch," said "Pennsylvania."

"That is Gaelic. So I read in a book."

"Penn reads a heap. Most of what he says is so--'cep' when it comes to
a caount o' fish--eh?"

"Does your father just let them say how many they've caught without
checking them?" said Harvey.

"Why, yes. Where's the sense of a man lyin' fer a few old cod?"

"Was a man once lied for his catch," Manuel put in. "Lied every day.
Fife, ten, twenty-fife more fish than come he say there was."

"Where was that?" said Dan. "None o' aour folk."

"Frenchman of Anguille."

"Ah! Them West Shore Frenchmen don't caount, anyway. Stands to reason
they can't caount. Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks, Harvey,
you'll know why," said Dan, with an awful contempt.

  "Always more and never less,
  Every time we come to dress,"

Long Jack roared down the hatch, and the "second ha'af" scrambled up at
once.

The shadow of the masts and rigging, with the never-furled riding-sail,
rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight; and the pile of
fish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver. In the hold there
were tramplings and rumblings where Disko Troop and Tom Platt moved
among the salt-bins. Dan passed Harvey a pitchfork, and led him to the
inboard end of the rough table, where Uncle Salters was drumming
impatiently with a knife-haft. A tub of salt water lay at his feet.

"You pitch to dad an' Tom Platt down the hatch, an' take keer Uncle
Salters don't cut yer eye out," said Dan, swinging himself into the
hold. "I'll pass salt below."

Penn and Manuel stood knee-deep among cod in the pen, flourishing drawn
knives. Long Jack, a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands, faced
Uncle Salters at the table, and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the
tub.

"Hi!" shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a
finger under its gill and a finger in its eye. He laid it on the edge
of the pen; the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the
fish, slit from throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck,
dropped at Long Jack's feet.

"Hi!" said Long Jack, with a scoop of his mittened hand. The cod's
liver dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and
offal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who
snorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the backbone flew
over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed
in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's astonished mouth.
After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along as
though they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the
miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.

"Pitch!" grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his head, and Harvey
pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.

"Hi! Pitch 'em bunchy," shouted Dan. "Don't scatter! Uncle Salters is
the best splitter in the fleet. Watch him mind his book!"

Indeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting
magazine pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips,
stayed like a statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without
ceasing. Little Penn toiled valiantly, but it was easy to see he was
weak. Once or twice Manuel found time to help him without breaking the
chain of supplies, and once Manuel howled because he had caught his
finger in a Frenchman's hook. These hooks are made of soft metal, to be
rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and are
hooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the
Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.

Down below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh
sounded like the whirring of a grindstone--a steady undertune to the
"click-nick" of the knives in the pen; the wrench and schloop of torn
heads, dropped liver, and flying offal; the "caraaah" of Uncle
Salters's knife scooping away backbones; and the flap of wet, opened
bodies falling into the tub.

At the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for
fresh, wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his back ached with
the steady pitching. But he felt for the first time in his life that he
was one of a working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held
on sullenly.

"Knife oh!" shouted Uncle Salters, at last. Penn doubled up, gasping
among the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long
Jack leaned over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black
shadow, collected a mass of backbones and heads, and retreated.

"Blood-ends for breakfast an' head-chowder," said Long Jack, smacking
his lips.

"Knife oh!" repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter's
weapon.

"Look by your foot, Harve," cried Dan, below.

Harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing.
He dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.

"Water!" said Disko Troop.

"Scuttle-butt's for'ard, an' the dipper's alongside. Hurry, Harve,"
said Dan.

He was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which
tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.

"These are cod," said Disko. "They ain't Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor
yet silver bars. I've told you that every single time sence we've
sailed together."

"A matter o' seven seasons," returned Tom Platt, coolly. "Good stowin's
good stowin' all the same, an' there's a right an' a wrong way o'
stowin' ballast even. If you'd ever seen four hundred ton o' iron set
into the--"

"Hi!" With a yell from Manuel the work began again, and never stopped
till the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop
rolled aft to the cabin with his brother; Manuel and Long Jack went
forward; Tom Platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere
he too disappeared. In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the
cabin, and he was staring blankly at Dan and Penn.

"I did a little better that time, Danny," said Penn, whose eyelids were
heavy with sleep. "But I think it is my duty to help clean."

"'Wouldn't hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal," said Dan. "Turn
in, Penn. You've no call to do boy's work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh,
Penn, dump these in the gurry-butt 'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake
that long?"

Penn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask
with a hinged top lashed by the fo'c'sle; then he too dropped out of
sight in the cabin.

"Boys clean up after dressin' down, an' first watch in ca'am weather is
boy's watch on the 'We're Here'." Dan sluiced the pen energetically,
unshipped the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red
knife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a
tiny grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under
his direction.

At the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the
oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with
a shout, but Dan only laughed. "Grampus," said he. "Beggin' fer
fish-heads. They up-eend thet way when they're hungry. Breath on him
like the doleful tombs, hain't he?" A horrible stench of decayed fish
filled the air as the pillar of white sank, and the water bubbled
oilily. "Hain't ye never seen a grampus up-eend before? You'll see 'em
by hundreds 'fore ye're through. Say, it's good to hev a boy aboard
again. Otto was too old, an' a Dutchy at that. Him an' me we fought
consid'ble. 'Wouldn't ha' keered fer thet ef he'd hed a Christian
tongue in his head. Sleepy?"

"Dead sleepy," said Harvey, nodding forward.

"'Mustn't sleep on watch. Rouse up an' see ef our anchor-light's bright
an' shinin'. You're on watch now, Harve."

"Pshaw! What's to hurt us? Bright's day. Sn-orrr!

"Jest when things happen, dad says. Fine weather's good sleepin', an'
'fore you know, mebbe, you're cut in two by a liner, an' seventeen
brass-bound officers, all gen'elmen, lift their hand to it that your
lights was aout an' there was a thick fog. Harve, I've kinder took to
you, but ef you nod onct more I'll lay into you with a rope's end."

The moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a
slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the
cluttered decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a
knotted rope, walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who
yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt.

The lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a
little in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the
miserable procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened,
whimpered, and at last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on
his tongue, spoke of the beauty of watchfulness, and slashed away with
the rope's end, punishing the dories as often as he hit Harvey. At last
the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke little
Penn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side
on the main-hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to
their berths.



CHAPTER III

It was the forty-fathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart,
and sends you to breakfast ravening. They emptied a big tin dish of
juicy fragments of fish--the blood-ends the cook had collected
overnight. They cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess, who
were out fishing, sliced pork for the midday meal, swabbed down the
fo'c'sle, filled the lamps, drew coal and water for the cook, and
investigated the fore-hold, where the boat's stores were stacked. It
was another perfect day--soft, mild, and clear; and Harvey breathed to
the very bottom of his lungs.

More schooners had crept up in the night, and the long blue seas were
full of sails and dories. Far away on the horizon, the smoke of some
liner, her hull invisible, smudged the blue, and to eastward a big
ship's topgallantsails, just lifting, made a square nick in it. Disko
Troop was smoking by the roof of the cabin--one eye on the craft
around, and the other on the little fly at the mainmast-head.

"When dad kerflummoxes that way," said Dan, in a whisper, "he's doin'
some high-line thinkin' fer all hands. I'll lay my wage an' share we'll
make berth soon. Dad he knows the cod, an' the fleet they know dad
knows. 'See 'em comin' up one by one, lookin' fer nothin' in
particular, o' course, but scrowgin' on us all the time? There's the
Prince Leboa; she's a Chat-ham boat. She's crep' up sence last night.
An' see that big one with a patch in her foresail an' a new jib? She's
the Carrie Pitman from West Chatham. She won't keep her canvas long on
less her luck's changed since last season. She don't do much 'cep'
drift. There ain't an anchor made'll hold her. . . . When the smoke
puffs up in little rings like that, dad's studyin' the fish. Ef we
speak to him now, he'll git mad. Las' time I did, he jest took an' hove
a boot at me."

Disko Troop stared forward, the pipe between his teeth, with eyes that
saw nothing. As his son said, he was studying the fish--pitting his
knowledge and experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his own
sea. He accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the
horizon as a compliment to his powers. But now that it was paid, he
wished to draw away and make his berth alone, till it was time to go up
to the Virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the
waters. So Disko Troop thought of recent weather, and gales, currents,
food-supplies, and other domestic arrangements, from the point of view
of a twenty-pound cod; was, in fact, for an hour a cod himself, and
looked remarkably like one. Then he removed the pipe from his teeth.

"Dad," said Dan, "we've done our chores. Can't we go overside a piece?
It's good catch-in' weather."

"Not in that cherry-coloured rig ner them ha'afbaked brown shoes. Give
him suthin' fit to wear."

"Dad's pleased--that settles it," said Dan, delightedly, dragging
Harvey into the cabin, while Troop pitched a key down the steps. "Dad
keeps my spare rig where he kin overhaul it, 'cause ma sez I'm
keerless." He rummaged through a locker, and in less than three minutes
Harvey was adorned with fisherman's rubber boots that came half up his
thigh, a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows, a pair of
flippers, and a sou'wester.

"Naow ye look somethin' like," said Dan. "Hurry!"

"Keep nigh an' handy," said Troop, "an' don't go visitin' raound the
fleet. Ef any one asks you what I'm cal'latin' to do, speak the
truth--fer ye don't know."

A little red dory, labelled Hattie S., lay astern of the schooner. Dan
hauled in the painter, and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards,
while Harvey tumbled clumsily after.

"That's no way o' gettin' into a boat," said Dan. "Ef there was any sea
you'd go to the bottom, sure. You got to learn to meet her."

Dan fitted the thole-pins, took the forward thwart, and watched
Harvey's work. The boy had rowed, in a ladylike fashion, on the
Adirondack ponds; but there is a difference between squeaking pins and
well-balanced rowlocks--light sculls and stubby, eight-foot sea-oars.
They stuck in the gentle swell, and Harvey grunted.

"Short! Row short!" said Dan. "Ef you cramp your oar in any kind o' sea
you're liable to turn her over. Ain't she a daisy? Mine, too."

The little dory was specklessly clean. In her bows lay a tiny anchor,
two jugs of water, and some seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding.
A tin dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey's right hand,
beside an ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden stick.
A couple of lines, with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all
neatly coiled on square reels, were stuck in their place by the gunwale.

"Where's the sail and mast?" said Harvey, for his hands were beginning
to blister.

Dan chuckled. "Ye don't sail fishin'-dories much. Ye pull; but ye
needn't pull so hard. Don't you wish you owned her?"

"Well, I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked 'em,"
Harvey replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till
then.

"That's so. I forgot your dad's a millionaire. You don't act millionary
any, naow. But a dory an' craft an' gear"--Dan spoke as though she were
a whale-boat "costs a heap. Think your dad 'u'd give you one fer--fer a
pet like?"

"Shouldn't wonder. It would be 'most the only thing I haven't stuck him
for yet."

"Must be an expensive kinder kid to home. Don't slitheroo thet way,
Harve. Short's the trick, because no sea's ever dead still, an' the
swells'll--"

Crack! The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him
backward.

"That was what I was goin' to say. I hed to learn too, but I wasn't
more than eight years old when I got my schoolin'."

Harvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown.

"No good gettin' mad at things, dad says. It's our own fault ef we
can't handle 'em, he says. Le's try here. Manuel'll give us the water."

The "Portugee" was rocking fully a mile away, but when Dan up-ended an
oar he waved his left arm three times.

"Thirty fathom," said Dan, stringing a salt clam on to the hook. "Over
with the dough-boys. Bait same's I do, Harve, an' don't snarl your
reel."

Dan's line was out long before Harvey had mastered the mystery of
baiting and heaving out the leads. The dory drifted along easily. It
was not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground.

"Here we come!" Dan shouted, and a shower of spray rattled on Harvey's
shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside. "Muckle, Harvey,
muckle! Under your hand! Quick!"

Evidently "muckle" could not be the dinner-horn, so Harvey passed over
the maul, and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it
inboard, and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he
called a "gob-stick." Then Harvey felt a tug, and pulled up zealously.

"Why, these are strawberries!" he shouted. "Look!"

The hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries, red on one side and
white on the other--perfect reproductions of the land fruit, except
that there were no leaves, and the stem was all pipy and slimy.

"Don't tech 'em! Slat 'em off. Don't--"

The warning came too late. Harvey had picked them from the hook, and
was admiring them.

"Ouch!" he cried, for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped
many nettles.

"Naow ye know what strawberry-bottom means. Nothin' 'cep' fish should
be teched with the naked fingers, dad says. Slat 'em off ag'in' the
gunnel, an' bait up, Harve. Lookin' won't help any. It's all in the
wages."

Harvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month, and
wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over
the edge of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean. She suffered agonies whenever
he went out on Saranac Lake; and, by the way, Harvey remembered
distinctly that he used to laugh at her anxieties. Suddenly the line
flashed through his hand, stinging even through the "flippers," the
woolen circlets supposed to protect it.

"He's a logy. Give him room accordin' to his strength," cried Dan.
"I'll help ye."

"No, you won't," Harvey snapped, as he hung on to the line. "It's my
first fish. Is--is it a whale?"

"Halibut, mebbe." Dan peered down into the water alongside, and
flourished the big "muckle," ready for all chances. Something white and
oval flickered and fluttered through the green. "I'll lay my wage an'
share he's over a hundred. Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him
alone?" Harvey's knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been
banged against the gunwale; his face was purple-blue between excitement
and exertion; he dripped with sweat, and was half blinded from staring
at the circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line. The boys
were tired long ere the halibut, who took charge of them and the dory
for the next twenty minutes. But the big flat fish was gaffed and
hauled in at last.

"Beginner's luck," said Dan, wiping his forehead. "He's all of a
hundred."

Harvey looked at the huge grey-and-mottled creature with unspeakable
pride. He had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore, but it
had never occurred to him to ask how they came inland. Now he knew; and
every inch of his body ached with fatigue.

"Ef dad was along," said Dan, hauling up, "he'd read the signs plain's
print. The fish are runnin' smaller an' smaller, an' you've took baout
as logy a halibut's we're apt to find this trip. Yesterday's catch--did
ye notice it?--was all big fish an' no halibut. Dad he'd read them
signs right off. Dad says everythin' on the Banks is signs, an' can be
read wrong er right. Dad's deeper'n the Whale-hole."

Even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the "We're Here", and a
potato-basket was run up in the fore-rigging.

"What did I say, naow? That's the call fer the whole crowd. Dad's onter
something, er he'd never break fishin' this time o' day. Reel up,
Harve, an' we'll pull back."

They were to windward of the schooner, just ready to flirt the dory
over the still sea, when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to
Penn, who was careering around a fixed point, for all the world like a
gigantic water-bug. The little man backed away and came down again with
enormous energy, but at the end of each manoeuvre his dory swung round
and snubbed herself on her rope.

"We'll hey to help him, else he'll root an' seed here," said Dan.

"What's the matter?" said Harvey. This was a new world, where he could
not lay down the law to his elders, but had to ask questions humbly.
And the sea was horribly big and unexcited.

"Anchor's fouled. Penn's always losing 'em. Lost two this trip
a'ready,--on sandy bottom, too,--an' dad says next one he loses, sure's
fish-in', he'll give him the kelleg. That 'u'd break Penn's heart."

"What's a 'kelleg'?" said Harvey, who had a vague idea it might be some
kind of marine torture, like keel-hauling in the story-books.

"Big stone instid of an anchor. You kin see a kelleg ridin' in the bows
fur's you can see a dory, an' all the fleet knows what it means. They'd
guy him dreadful. Penn couldn't stand that no more'n a dog with a
dipper to his tail. He's so everlastin' sensitive. Hello, Penn! Stuck
again? Don't try any more o' your patents. Come up on her, and keep
your rodin' straight up an' down."

"It doesn't move," said the little man, panting. "It doesn't move at
all, and indeed I tried everything."

"What's all this hurrah's-nest for'ard?" said Dan, pointing to a wild
tangle of spare oars and dory-roding, all matted together by the hand of
inexperience.

"Oh, that," said Penn, proudly, "is a Spanish windlass. Mr. Salters
showed me how to make it; but even that doesn't move her."

Dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile, twitched once or twice
on the roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.

"Haul up, Penn," he said, laughing, "er she 'll git stuck again."

They left him regarding the weed-hung flukes of the little anchor with
big, pathetic blue eyes, and thanking them profusely.

"Oh, say, while I think of it, Harve," said Dan, when they were out of
ear-shot, "Penn ain't quite all caulked. He ain't nowise dangerous, but
his mind's give out. See?"

"Is that so, or is it one of your father's judgments?" Harvey asked, as
he bent to his oars. He felt he was learning to handle them more easily.

"Dad ain't mistook this time. Penn's a sure'nuff loony. No, he ain't
thet, exactly, so much ez a harmless ijjit. It was this way (you're
rowin' quite so, Harve), an' I tell you 'cause it's right you orter
know. He was a Moravian preacher once. Jacob Boller wuz his name, dad
told me, an' he lived with his wife an' four children somewheres out
Pennsylvania way. Well, Penn he took his folks along to a Moravian
meetin',--camp-meetin', most like,--an' they stayed over jest one night
in Johnstown. You've heered talk o' Johnstown?"

Harvey considered. "Yes, I have. But I don't know why. It sticks in my
head same as Ashtabula."

"Both was big accidents--thet's why, Harve. Well, that one single night
Penn and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out. 'Dam bu'st
an' flooded her, an' the houses struck adrift an' bumped into each
other an' sunk. I've seen the pictures, an' they're dretful. Penn he
saw his folk drowned all 'n a heap 'fore he rightly knew what was
comin'. His mind give out from that on. He mistrusted somethin' hed
happened up to Johnstown, but for the poor life of him he couldn't
remember what, an' he jest drifted araound smilin' an' wonderin'. He
didn't know what he was, nor yit what he hed bin, an' thet way he run
ag'in' Uncle Salters, who was visitin' 'n Allegheny City. Ha'af my
mother's folks they live scattered inside o' Pennsylvania, an' Uncle
Salters he visits araound winters. Uncle Salters he kinder adopted
Penn, well knowin' what his trouble wuz; an' he brought him East, an'
he give him work on his farm."

"Why, I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats
bumped. Is your Uncle Salters a farmer?"

"Farmer!" shouted Dan. "There ain't water enough 'tween here an'
Hatt'rus to wash the furrer-mould off'n his boots. He's Jest
everlastin' farmer. Why, Harve, I've seen thet man hitch up a bucket,
long towards sundown, an' set twiddlin' the spigot to the scuttle-butt
same's ef 'twuz a cow's bag. He's thet much farmer. Well, Penn an' he
they ran the farm--up Exeter way, 'twuz. Uncle Salters he sold it this
spring to a jay from Boston as wanted to build a summerhaouse, an' he
got a heap for it. Well, them two loonies scratched along till, one
day, Penn's church he'd belonged to--the Moravians--found out where he
wuz drifted an' layin', an' wrote to Uncle Salters. 'Never heerd what
they said exactly; but Uncle Salters was mad. He's a 'piscopalian
mostly--but he jest let 'em hev it both sides o' the bow, 'sif he was a
Baptist, an' sez he warn't goin' to give up Penn to any blame Moravian
connection in Pennsylvania or anywheres else. Then he come to dad,
towin' Penn,--thet was two trips back,--an' sez he an' Penn must fish a
trip fer their health. 'Guess he thought the Moravians wouldn't hunt
the Banks fer Jacob Boller. Dad was agreeable, fer Uncle Salters he'd
been fishin' off an' on fer thirty years, when he warn't inventin'
patent manures, an' he took quarter-share in the 'We're Here'; an' the
trip done Penn so much good, dad made a habit o' takin' him. Some day,
dad sez, he'll remember his wife an' kids an' Johnstown, an' then,
like's not, he'll die, dad sez. Don't yer talk about Johnstown ner such
things to Penn, 'r Uncle Salters he'll heave ye overboard."

"Poor Penn!" murmured Harvey. "I shouldn't ever have thought Uncle
Salters cared for him by the look of 'em together."

"I like Penn, though; we all do," said Dan. "We ought to ha' give him a
tow, but I wanted to tell ye first."

They were close to the schooner now, the other boats a little behind
them.

"You needn't heave in the dories till after dinner," said Troop, from
the deck. "We'll dress-daown right off. Fix table, boys!"

"Deeper'n the Whale-deep," said Dan, with a wink, as he set the gear
for dressing-down. "Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin'.
They're all waitin' on dad. See 'em, Harve?"

"They are all alike to me." And, indeed, to a landsman the nodding
schooners around seemed run from the same mould.

"They ain't, though. That yaller, dirty packet with her bowsprit
steeved that way, she's the 'Hope of Prague'. Nick Brady's her skipper,
the meanest man on the Banks. We'll tell him so when we strike the Main
Ledge. 'Way off yander's the 'Day's Eye'. The two Jeraulds own her.
She's from Harwich; fastish, too, an' hez good luck; but dad he'd find
fish in a graveyard. Them other three, side along, they're the 'Margie
Smith', 'Rose', and 'Edith S. Walen', all frum home. 'Guess we'll see
the 'Abbie M. Deering' to-morrer, dad, won't we? They're all slippin'
over from the shoal o' 'Queereau."

"You won't see many boats to-morrow, Danny." When Troop called his son
Danny, it was a sign that the old man was pleased. "Boys, we're too
crowded," he went on, addressing the crew as they clambered inboard.
"We'll leave 'em to bait big an' catch small." He looked at the catch
in the pen, and it was curious to see how little and level the fish
ran. Save for Harvey's halibut, there was nothing over fifteen pounds
on deck.

"I'm waitin' on the weather," he added.

"Ye'll have to make it yourself, Disko, for there's no sign I can see,"
said Long Jack, sweeping the clear horizon.

And yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing-down, the Bank fog
dropped on them, "between fish and fish," as they say. It drove
steadily and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless
water. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and
Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began
to heave up the anchor, the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable
strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last.
The anchor came up with a sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop
steadied her at the wheel. "Up jib and foresail," said he.

"Slip 'em in the smother," shouted Long Jack, making fast the
jib-sheet, while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the
foresail; and the fore-boom creaked as the "We're Here" looked up into
the wind and dived off into blank, whirling white.

"There's wind behind this fog," said Troop.

It was all wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful
part was that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop,
ending with, "That's good, my son!"

"'Never seen anchor weighed before?" said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping
at the damp canvas of the foresail.

"No. Where are we going?"

"Fish and make berth, as you'll find out 'fore you've bin a week
aboard. It's all new to you, but we never know what may come to us.
Now, take me--Tom Platt--I'd never ha' thought--"

"It's better than fourteen dollars a month an' a bullet in your belly,"
said Troop, from the wheel. "Ease your jumbo a grind."

"Dollars an' cents better," returned the man-o'-war's man, doing
something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. "But we didn't
think o' that when we manned the windlass-brakes on the 'Miss Jim
Buck',[1] outside Beaufort Harbor, with Fort Macon heavin' hot shot at
our stern, an' a livin' gale atop of all. Where was you then, Disko?"

"Jest here, or hereabouts," Disko replied, "earnin' my bread on the
deep waters, and dodgin' Reb privateers. 'Sorry I can't accommodate you
with red-hot shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we'll come aout all right on
wind 'fore we see Eastern Point."

There was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by
a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the
fo'c'sle. The rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along
the lee of the house--all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the
main-hatch nursing his stung hands.


[1] The Gemsbok, U. S. N.?


"'Guess she'd carry stays'l," said Disko, rolling one eye at his
brother.

"Guess she wouldn't to any sorter profit. What's the sense o' wastin'
canvas?" the farmer-sailor replied.

The wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko's hands. A few seconds
later a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote
Uncle Salters between the shoulders, and drenched him from head to
foot. He rose sputtering, and went forward, only to catch another.

"See dad chase him, all around the deck," said Dan. "Uncle Salters he
thinks his quarter-share's our canvas. Dad's put this duckin' act up on
him two trips runnin'. Hi! That found him where he feeds." Uncle
Salters had taken refuge by the foremast, but a wave slapped him over
the knees. Disko's face was as blank as the circle of the wheel.

"'Guess she'd lie easier under stays'l, Salters," said Disko, as though
he had seen nothing.

"Set your old kite, then," roared the victim, through a cloud of spray;
"only don't lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right
off an' git your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum
araound on deck this weather."

"Now they'll swill coffee an' play checkers till the cows come home,"
said Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore-cabin. "'Looks to
me like's if we'd all be doin' so fer a spell. There's nothin' in
creation deader-limpsey-idler'n a Banker when she ain't on fish."

"I'm glad ye spoke, Danny," cried Long Jack, who had been casting round
in search of amusement. "I'd clean forgot we'd a passenger under that
T-wharf hat. There's no idleness for thim that don't know their ropes.
Pass him along, Tom Platt, an' we'll l'arn him."

"'Tain't my trick this time," grinned Dan. "You've got to go it alone.
Dad learned me with a rope's end."

For an hour Long Jack walked his prey up and down, teaching, as he
said, "things at the sea that ivry man must know, blind, dhrunk, or
asleep." There is not much gear to a seventy-ton schooner with a
stump-foremast, but Long Jack had a gift of expression. When he wished
to draw Harvey's attention to the peak-halyards, he dug his knuckles
into the back of the boy's neck and kept him at gaze for half a minute.
He emphasised the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing
Harvey's nose along a few feet of the boom, and the lead of each rope
was fixed in Harvey's mind by the end of the rope itself.

The lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free; but
there appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a
man. Forward lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp
cables, all very unpleasant to trip over; the fo'c'sle stovepipe, and
the gurry-butts by the fo'c'sle-hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of
these the fore-boom and booby of the main-hatch took all the space that
was not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came the nests of
dories lashed to ring-bolts by the quarter-deck; the house, with tubs
and oddments lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot main-boom
in its crutch, splitting things lengthwise, to duck and dodge under
every time.

Tom Platt, of course, could not keep his oar out of the business, but
ranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails
and spars on the old Ohio.

"Niver mind fwhat he says; attind to me, Innocince. Tom Platt, this
bally-hoo's not the Ohio, an' you're mixing the bhoy bad."

"He'll be ruined for life, beginnin' on a fore-an'-after this way," Tom
Platt pleaded. "Give him a chance to know a few leadin' principles.
Sailin's an art, Harvey, as I'd show you if I had ye in the foretop o'
the--"

"I know ut. Ye'd talk him dead an' cowld. Silince, Tom Platt! Now,
after all I've said, how'd you reef the foresail, Harve'? Take your
time answerin'."

"Haul that in," said Harvey, pointing to leeward.

"Fwhat? The North Atlantuc?"

"No, the boom. Then run that rope you showed me back there--"

"That's no way," Tom Platt burst in.

"Quiet! He's l'arnin', an' has not the names good yet. Go on, Harve."

"Oh, it's the reef-pennant. I'd hook the tackle on to the reef-pennant,
and then let down--"

"Lower the sail, child! Lower!" said Tom Platt, in a professional agony.

"Lower the throat-and peak-halyards," Harvey went on. Those names stuck
in his head.

"Lay your hand on thim," said Long Jack.

Harvey obeyed. "Lower till that rope-loop--on the
after-leach--kris--no, it's cringle--till the cringle was down on the
boom. Then I'd tie her up the way you said, and then I'd hoist up the
peak-and throat-halyards again."

"You've forgot to pass the tack-earing, but wid time and help ye'll
l'arn. There's good and just reason for ivry rope aboard, or else
'twould be overboard. D'ye follow me? 'Tis dollars an' cents I'm
puttin' into your pocket, ye skinny little supercargo, so that fwhin
ye've filled out ye can ship from Boston to Cuba an' tell thim Long
Jack l'arned you. Now I'll chase ye around a piece, callin' the ropes,
an' you'll lay your hand on thim as I call."

He began, and Harvey, who was feeling rather tired, walked slowly to
the rope named. A rope's end licked round his ribs, and nearly knocked
the breath out of him.

"When you own a boat," said Tom Platt, with severe eyes, "you can walk.
Till then, take all orders at the run. Once more--to make sure!"

Harvey was in a glow with the exercise, and this last cut warmed him
thoroughly. Now, he was a singularly smart boy, the son of a very
clever man and a very sensitive woman, with a fine resolute temper that
systematic spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy. He looked at
the other men, and saw that even Dan did not smile. It was evidently
all in the day's work, though it hurt abominably; so he swallowed the
hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin. The same smartness that led him
to take such advantage of his mother made him very sure that no one on
the boat, except, maybe, Penn, would stand the least nonsense. One
learns a great deal from a mere tone. Long Jack called over half a
dozen more ropes, and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at
ebb-tide, one eye on Tom Platt.

"Ver' good. Ver' good done," said Manuel. "After supper I show you a
little schooner I make, with all her ropes. So we shall learn."

"Fust-class fer--a passenger," said Dan. "Dad he's jest allowed you'll
be wuth your salt maybe 'fore you're draownded. Thet's a heap fer dad.
I'll learn you more our next watch together."

"Taller!" grunted Disko, peering through the fog as it smoked over the
bows. There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging
jib-boom, while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale
waves whispering and upping one to the other.

"Now I'll learn you something Long Jack can't," shouted Tom Platt, as
from a locker by the stern he produced a battered deep-sea lead
hollowed at one end, smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton
tallow, and went forward. "I'll learn you how to fly the Blue Pigeon.
Shooo!"

Disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner's way, while
Manuel, with Harvey to help (and a proud boy was Harvey), let down the
jib in a lump on the boom. The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom
Platt whirled it round and round.

"Go ahead, man," said Long Jack, impatiently. "We're not drawin'
twenty-five fut off Fire Island in a fog. There's no trick to ut."

"Don't be jealous, Galway." The released lead plopped into the sea far
ahead as the schooner surged slowly forward.

"Soundin' is a trick, though," said Dan, "when your dipsey lead's all
the eye you're like to hev for a week. What d'you make it, dad?"

Disko's face relaxed. His skill and honour were involved in the march
he had stolen on the rest of the fleet, and he had his reputation as a
master artist who knew the Banks blindfold. "Sixty, mebbe--ef I'm any
judge," he replied, with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of
the house.

"Sixty," sung out Tom Platt, hauling in great wet coils.

The schooner gathered way once more. "Heave!" said Disko, after a
quarter of an hour.

"What d'you make it?" Dan whispered, and he looked at Harvey proudly.
But Harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just
then.

"Fifty," said the father. "I mistrust we're right over the nick o'
Green Bank on old Sixty-Fifty."

"Fifty!" roared Tom Platt. They could scarcely see him through the fog.
"She's bu'st within a yard--like the shells at Fort Macon."

"Bait up, Harve," said Dan, diving for a line on the reel.

The schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother,
her head-sail banging wildly. The men waited and looked at the boys,
who began fishing.

"Heugh!" Dan's lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail. "Now haow
in thunder did dad know? Help us here, Harve. It's a big un.
Poke-hooked, too." They hauled together, and landed a goggle-eyed
twenty-pound cod. He had taken the bait right into his stomach.

"Why, he's all covered with little crabs," cried Harvey, turning him
over.

"By the great hook-block, they're lousy already," said Long Jack.
"Disko, ye kape your spare eyes under the keel."

Splash went the anchor, and they all heaved over the lines, each man
taking his own place at the bulwarks.

"Are they good to eat?" Harvey panted, as he lugged in another
crab-covered cod.

"Sure. When they're lousy it's a sign they've all been herdin' together
by the thousand, and when they take the bait that way they're hungry.
Never mind how the bait sets. They'll bite on the bare hook."

"Say, this is great!" Harvey cried, as the fish came in gasping and
splashing--nearly all poke-hooked, as Dan had said. "Why can't we
always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?"

"Allus can, till we begin to dress-daown. Efter thet, the heads and
offals 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned
progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll
run aout aour trawl to-night. Harder on the back, this, than frum the
dory, ain't it?"

It was rather back-breaking work, for in a dory the weight of a cod is
water-borne till the last minute, and you are, so to speak, abreast of
him; but the few feet of a schooner's free-board make so much extra
dead-hauling, and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach. But it
was wild and furious sport so long as it lasted; and a big pile lay
aboard when the fish ceased biting.

"Where's Penn and Uncle Salters?" Harvey asked, slapping the slime off
his oilskins, and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the
others.

"Git's coffee and see."

Under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawl-post, the fo'c'sle table
down and opened, utterly unconscious of fish or weather, sat the two
men, a checker-board between them, Uncle Salters snarling at Penn's
every move.

"What's the matter naow?" said the former, as Harvey, one hand in the
leather loop at the head of the ladder, hung shouting to the cook.

"Big fish and lousy-heaps and heaps," Harvey replied, quoting Long
Jack. "How's the game?"

Little Penn's jaw dropped. "Tweren't none o' his fault," snapped Uncle
Salters. "Penn's deef."

"Checkers, weren't it?" said Dan, as Harvey staggered aft with the
steaming coffee in a tin pail. "That lets us out o' cleanin' up
to-night. Dad's a jest man. They'll have to do it."

"An' two young fellers I know'll bait up a tub or so o' trawl, while
they're cleanin'," said Disko, lashing the wheel to his taste.

"Urn! 'Guess I'd ruther clean up, dad."

"Don't doubt it. Ye wun't, though. Dress-daown! Dress-daown! Penn'll
pitch while you two bait up."

"Why in thunder didn't them blame boys tell us you'd struck on?" said
Uncle Salters, shuffling to his place at the table. "This knife's
gum-blunt, Dan."

"Ef stickin' out cable don't wake ye, guess you'd better hire a boy o'
your own," said Dan, muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of
trawl-line lashed to windward of the house. "Oh, Harve, don't ye want
to slip down an' git's bait?"

"Bait ez we are," said Disko. "I mistrust shag-fishin' will pay better,
ez things go."

That meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the
fish were cleaned--an improvement on paddling barehanded in the little
bait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a
big hook each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single
hook, with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear
when shot from the dory, was a scientific business. Dan managed it in
the dark without looking, while Harvey caught his fingers on the barbs
and bewailed his fate. But the hooks flew through Dan's fingers like
tatting on an old maid's lap. "I helped bait up trawl ashore 'fore I
could well walk," he said. "But it's a putterin' job all the same. Oh,
dad!" This shouted towards the hatch, where Disko and Tom Platt were
salting. "How many skates you reckon we'll need?"

"Baout three. Hurry!"

"There's three hundred fathom to each tub," Dan explained; "more'n
enough to lay out tonight. Ouch! 'Slipped up there, I did." He stuck
his finger in his mouth. "I tell you, Harve, there ain't money in
Gloucester'u'd hire me to ship on a reg'lar trawler. It may be
progressive, but, barrin' that, it's the putterin'est, slimjammest
business top of earth."

"I don't know what this is, if 'tisn't regular trawling," said Harvey,
sulkily. "My fingers are all cut to frazzles."

"Pshaw! This is jest one o' dad's blame experiments. He don't trawl
'less there's mighty good reason fer it. Dad knows. Thet's why he's
baitin' ez he is. We'll hev her saggin' full when we take her up er we
won't see a fin."

Penn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained, but the boys
profited little. No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and
Long Jack, who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern,
snatched them away, loaded up the tubs and some small, painted
trawl-buoys, and hove the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as
an exceedingly rough sea. "They'll be drowned. Why, the dory's loaded
like a freight-car," he cried.

"We'll be back," said Long Jack, "an' in case you'll not be lookin' for
us, we'll lay into you both if the trawl's snarled."

The dory surged up on the crest of a wave, and just when it seemed
impossible that she could avoid smashing against the schooner's side,
slid over the ridge, and was swallowed up in the damp dusk.

"Take a-hold here, an' keep ringin' steady," said Dan, passing Harvey
the lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass.

Harvey rang lustily, for he felt two lives depended on him. But Disko
in the cabin, scrawling in the log-book, did not look like a murderer,
and when he went to supper he even smiled drily at the anxious Harvey.

"This ain't no weather," said Dan. "Why, you an' me could set thet
trawl! They've only gone out jest far 'nough so's not to foul our
cable. They don't need no bell reelly."

"Clang! cling! clang!" Harvey kept it up, varied with occasional
rub-a-dubs, for another half-hour. There was a bellow and a bump
alongside. Manuel and Dan raced to the hooks of the dory-tackle; Long
Jack and Tom Platt arrived on deck together, it seemed, one half the
North Atlantic at their backs, and the dory followed them in the air,
landing with a clatter.

"Nary snarl," said Tom Platt, as he dripped. "Danny, you'll do yet."

"The pleasure av your comp'ny to the banquit," said Long Jack,
squelching the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and
stuck an oilskinned arm into Harvey's face. "We do be condescending to
honour the second half wid our presence." And off they all four rolled
to supper, where Harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fish-chowder and
fried pies, and fell fast asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker
a lovely two-foot model of the Lucy Holmes, his first boat, and was
going to show Harvey the ropes. Harvey never even twiddled his fingers
as Penn pushed him into his bunk.

"It must be a sad thing--a very sad thing," said Penn, watching the
boy's face, "for his mother and his father, who think he is dead. To
lose a child--to lose a man-child!"

"Git out o' this, Penn," said Dan. "Go aft and finish your game with
Uncle Salters. Tell dad I'll stand Harve's watch ef he don't keer. He's
played aout."

"Ver' good boy," said Manuel, slipping out of his boots and
disappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk. "Expec' he make
good man, Danny. I no see he is any so mad as your parpa he says. Eh,
wha-at?"

Dan chuckled, but the chuckle ended in a snore.

It was thick weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men
stretched their watches. The hours struck clear in the cabin; the
nosing bows slapped and scuffled with the seas; the fo'c'sle stovepipe
hissed and sputtered as the spray caught it; and the boys slept on,
while Disko, Long Jack, Tom Plait, and Uncle Salters, each in turn,
stumped aft to look at the wheel, forward to see that the anchor held,
or to veer out a little more cable against chafing, with a glance at
the dim anchor-light between each round.



CHAPTER IV

Harvey waked to find the "first half" at 'breakfast, the fo'c'sle door
drawn to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own
tune. The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over
the glare of the stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden
board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the
fo'c'sle climbed, yearning and surging and quivering, and then, with a
clear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the seas. He could hear the
flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere the divided
waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of buck-shot.
Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; a grunt and
squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the "We're Here"
gathered herself together to repeat the motions.

"Now, ashore," he heard Long Jack saying, "ye've chores, an' ye must do
thim in any weather. Here we're well clear of the fleet, an' we've no
chores--an' that's a blessin'. Good night, all." He passed like a big
snake from the table to his bunk, and began to smoke. Tom Platt
followed his example; Uncle Salters, with Penn, fought his way up the
ladder to stand his watch, and the cook set for the "second half."

It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake
and a yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled
his pipe with some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the
pawl-post and a forward bunk, cocked his feet up on the table, and
smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke. Dan lay at length in
his bunk, wrestling with a gaudy, gilt-stopped accordion, whose tunes
went up and down with the pitching of the "We're Here". The cook, his
shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies (Dan was fond
of fried pies), peeled potatoes, with one eye on the stove in event of
too much water finding its way down the pipe; and the general smell and
smother were past all description.

Harvey considered affairs, wondered that he was not deathly sick, and
crawled into his bunk again, as the softest and safest place, while Dan
struck up, "I don't want to play in your yard," as accurately as the
wild jerks allowed.

"How long is this for?" Harvey asked of Manuel.

"Till she get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps
to-night. Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?"

"I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn't seem to upset
me now--much."

"That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when
I come to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good
luck."

"Give who?"

"To be sure--the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She is very good to
fishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are
drowned."

"You're a Roman Catholic, then?"

"I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist,
then? Eh, wha-at? I always give candles--two, three more when I come to
Gloucester. The good Virgin she never forgets me, Manuel."

"I don't sense it that way," Tom Platt put in from his bunk, his
scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe.
"It stands to reason the sea's the sea; and you'll git jest about
what's goin', candles or kerosene, fer that matter."

"Tis a mighty good thing," said Long Jack, "to have a fri'nd at coort,
though. I'm o' Manuel's way o' thinkin'. About tin years back I was
crew to a Sou' Boston market-boat. We was off Minot's Ledge wid a
northeaster, butt first, atop of us, thicker'n burgoo. The ould man was
dhrunk, his chin waggin' on the tiller, an' I sez to myself, 'If iver I
stick my boat-huk into T-wharf again, I'll show the saints fwhat manner
o' craft they saved me out av.' Now, I'm here, as ye can well see, an'
the model of the dhirty ould Kathleen, that took me a month to make, I
gave ut to the priest, an' he hung Ut up forninst the altar. There's
more sense in givin' a model that's by way o' bein' a work av art than
any candle. Ye can buy candles at store, but a model shows the good
saints ye've tuk trouble an' are grateful."

"D'you believe that, Irish?" said Tom Platt, turning on his elbow.

"Would I do Ut if I did not, Ohio?"

"Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he made a model o' the old Ohio, and she's to
Salem museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch he never
done it fer no sacrifice; an' the way I take it is--"

There were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that
fishermen love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one
proves anything at the end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:

  "Up jumped the mackerel with his striped back.
  Reef in the mainsail, and haul on the tack;
  For it's windy weather--"

Here Long Jack joined in:

  "And it's blowy weather;
  When the winds begin to blow, pipe all hands together!"

Dan went on, with a cautious look at Tom Plait, holding the accordion
low in the bunk:

  "Up jumped the cod with his chuckle-head,
  Went to the main-chains to heave at the lead;
  For it's windy weather," etc.

Tom Platt seemed to be hunting for something. Dan crouched lower, but
sang louder:

  "Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground.
  Chuckle-head! Chuckle-head!
  Mind where ye sound!"

Tom Platt's huge rubber boot whirled across the fo'c'sle and caught
Dan's uplifted arm. There was war between the man and the boy ever
since Dan had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would
make him angry as he heaved the lead.

"Thought I'd fetch yer," said Dan, returning the gift with precision.
"Ef you don't like my music, git out your fiddle. I ain't goin' to lie
here all day an' listen to you an' Long Jack arguin' 'baout candles.
Fiddle, Tom Platt; or I'll learn Harve here the tune!"

Tom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle.
Manuel's eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he drew
out a tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he called a
_machette_.

"'Tis a concert," said Long Jack, beaming through the smoke. "A reg'lar
Boston concert."

There was a burst of spray as the hatch opened, and Disko, in yellow
oilskins, descended.

"Ye're just in time, Disko. Fwhat's she doin' outside?"

"Jest this!" He dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of
the "We're Here".

"We're singin' to kape our breakfasts down. Ye'll lead, av course,
Disko," said Long Jack.

"Guess there ain't more'n 'baout two old songs I know, an' ye've heerd
them both."

His excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous
tune, like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts. With
his eyes fixed on the beams above, Disko began this ancient, ancient
ditty, Tom Platt flourishing all round him to make the tune and words
fit a little:

  "There is a crack packet--crack packet o' fame,
  She hails from Noo York, an' the Dreadnought's her name.
  You may talk o' your fliers--Swallow-tail and Black Ball--
  But the Dreadnought's the packet that can beat them all.

  "Now the Dreadnought she lies in the River Mersey,
  Because of the tugboat to take her to sea;
  But when she's off soundings you shortly will know
  (Chorus.)
  She's the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her go!

  "Now the Dreadnought she's howlin' 'crost the Banks o' Newfoundland,
  Where the water's all shallow and the bottom's all sand.
  Sez all the little fishes that swim to an' fro:
  (Chorus.)
  'She's the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her go!'"

There were scores of verses, for he worked the Dreadnought every mile
of the way between Liverpool and New York as conscientiously as though
he were on her deck, and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked
beside him. Tom Platt followed with something about "the rough and
tough McGinn, who would pilot the vessel in." Then they called on
Harvey, who felt very flattered, to contribute to the entertainment;
but all that he could remember were some pieces of "Skipper Ireson's
Ride" that he had been taught at the camp-school in the Adirondacks. It
seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place, but he had
no more than mentioned the title when Disko brought down one foot with
a bang, and cried, "Don't go on, young feller. That's a mistaken
jedgment--one o' the worst kind, too, becaze it's catchin' to the ear."

"I orter ha' warned you," said Dan. "Thet allus fetches dad."

"What's wrong?" said Harvey, surprised and a little angry.

"All you're goin' to say," said Disko. "All dead wrong from start to
finish, an' Whittier he's to blame. I have no special call to right any
Marblehead man, but 'tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. My father he told
me the tale time an' again, an' this is the way 'twuz."

"For the wan hundreth time," put in Long Jack, under his breath.

"Ben Ireson he was skipper o' the Betty, young feller, comin' home frum
the Banks--that was before the war of 1812, but jestice is jestice at
all times. They f'und the Active o' Portland, an' Gibbons o' that town
he was her skipper; they f'und her leakin' off Cape Cod Light. There
was a terr'ble gale on, an' they was gettin' the Betty home's fast as
they could craowd her. Well, Ireson he said there warn't any sense to
reskin' a boat in that sea; the men they wouldn't hev it; and he laid
it before them to stay by the Active till the sea run daown a piece.
They wouldn't hev that either, hangin' araound the Cape in any sech
weather, leak or no leak. They jest up stays'l an' quit, nat'rally
takin' Ireson with 'em. Folks to Marblehead was mad at him not runnin'
the risk, and becaze nex' day, when the sea was ca'am (they never
stopped to think o' that), some of the Active's folk was took off by a
Truro man. They come into Marblehead with their own tale to tell,
sayin' how Ireson had shamed his town, an' so forth an' so on; an'
Ireson's men they was scared, seem' public feelin' ag'in' 'em, an' they
went back on Ireson, an' swore he was respons'ble for the hull act.
'Tweren't the women neither that tarred and feathered him--Marblehead
women don't act that way--'twas a passel o' men an' boys, an' they
carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout, an'
Ireson he told 'em they'd be sorry for it some day. Well, the facts
came aout later, same's they usually do, too late to be any ways useful
to an honest man; an' Whittier he come along an' picked up the slack
eend of a lyin' tale, an' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct
more after he was dead. 'Twas the only time Whittier ever slipped up,
an' 'tweren't fair. I whaled Dan good when he brought that piece back
from school. You don't know no better, o' course; but I've give you
the facts, hereafter an' evermore to be remembered. Ben Ireson weren't
no sech kind o' man as Whittier makes aout; my father he knew him well,
before an' after that business, an' you beware o' hasty jedgments,
young feller. Next!"

Harvey had never heard Disko talk so long, and collapsed with burning
cheeks; but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he was
taught at school, and life was too short to keep track of every lie
along the coast.

Then Manuel touched the jangling, jarring little _machette_ to a queer
tune, and sang something in Portuguese about "Nina, innocente!" ending
with a full-handed sweep that brought the song up with a jerk. Then
Disko obliged with his second song, to an old-fashioned creaky tune,
and all joined in the chorus. This is one stanza:

  "Now Aprile is over and melted the snow,
  And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow;
  Yes, out o' Noo Bedford we shortly must clear,
  We're the whalers that never see wheat in the ear."

Here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself, and then:

  "Wheat-in-the-ear, my true-love's posy blowin';
  Wheat-in-the-ear, we're goin' off to sea;
  Wheat-in-the-ear, I left you fit for sowin';
  When I come back a loaf o' bread you'll be!"

That made Harvey almost weep, though he could not tell why. But it was
much worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands
for the fiddle. Still leaning against the locker door, he struck into a
tune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you
did. After a little he sang in an unknown tongue, his big chin down on
the fiddle-tail, his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight. Harvey
swung out of his bunk to hear better; and amid the straining of the
timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on, like
lee surf in a blind fog, till it ended with a wail.

"Jimmy Christmas! Thet gives me the blue creevles," said Dan.

"What in thunder is it?"

"The song of Fin McCoul," said the cook, "when he wass going to
Norway." His English was not thick, but all clear-cut, as though it
came from a phonograph.

"Faith, I've been to Norway, but I didn't make that unwholesim noise.
'Tis like some of the old songs, though," said Long Jack, sighing.

"Don't let's hev another 'thout somethin' between," said Dan; and the
accordion struck up a rattling, catchy tune that ended:

  "It's six an' twenty Sundays sence las' we saw the land,
  With fifteen hunder quintal,
  An' fifteen hunder quintal, 'Teen hunder toppin' quintal,
  'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand!"

"Hold on!" roared Tom Plait "D'ye want to nail the trip, Dan? That's
Jonah sure, 'less you sing it after all our salt's wet."

"No, 'tain't. Is it, dad? Not unless you sing the very las' verse. You
can't learn me anything on Jonahs!"

"What's that?" said Harvey. "What's a Jonah?"

"A Jonah's anything that spoils the luck. Sometimes it's a
man--sometimes it's a boy--or a bucket. I've known a splittin'-knife
Jonah two trips till we was on to her," said Tom Plait. "There's all
sorts o' Jonahs. Jim Bourke was one till he was drowned on Georges. I'd
never ship with Jim Bourke, not if I was starvin'. There wuz a green
dory on the Ezra Flood. Thet was a Jonah too, the worst sort o' Jonah.
Drowned four men she did, an' used to shine fiery o' nights in the
nest."

"And you believe that?" said Harvey, remembering what Tom Platt had
said about candles and models. "Haven't we all got to take what's
served?"

A mutter of dissent ran round the bunks. "Outboard, yes; inboard,
things can happen," said Disko. "Don't you go makin' a mock of Jonahs,
young feller."

"Well, Harve ain't no Jonah. Day after we catched him," Dan cut in, "we
had a toppin' good catch."

The cook threw up his head and laughed suddenly--a queer, thin laugh.
He was a most disconcerting nigger. "Murder!" said Long Jack. "Don't do
that again, doctor. We ain't used to Ut."

"What's wrong?" said Dan. "Ain't he our mascot, and didn't they strike
on good after we'd struck him?"

"Oh! yess," said the cook. "I know that, but the catch iss not finish
yet."

"He ain't goin' to do us any harm," said Dan, hotly. "Where are ye
hintin' an' edgin' to? He's all right."

"No harm. No. But one day he will be your master, Danny."

"That all?" said Dan, placidly. "He wun't--not by a jugful."

"Master!" said the cook, pointing to Harvey. "Man!" and he pointed to
Dan.

"That's news. Haow soon?" said Dan, with a laugh.

"In some years, and I shall see it. Master and man--man and master."

"How in thunder d'ye work that out?" said Tom Platt.

"In my head, where I can see."

"Haow?" This from all the others at once.

"I do not know, but so it will be." He dropped his head, and went on
peeling the potatoes, and not another word could they get out of him.

"Well," said Dan, "a heap o' things'll hev to come abaout 'fore Harve's
any master o' mine; but I'm glad the doctor ain't choosen to mark him
for a Jonah. Now, I mistrust Uncle Salters fer the Jonerest Jonah in
the fleet regardin' his own special luck. Dunno ef it's spreadin'
same's smallpox. He ought to be on the Carrie Pitman. That boat's her
own Jonah, sure--crews an' gear make no differ to her driftin'. Jimmy
Christmas! She'll etch loose in a flat ca'am."

"We're well dear o' the fleet, anyway," said Disko, "Carrie Pitman an'
all." There was a rapping on the deck.

"Uncle Salters has catched his luck," said Dan, as his father departed.

"It's blown clear," Disko cried, and all the fo'c'sle tumbled up for a
bit of fresh air. The fog had gone, but a sullen sea ran in great
rollers behind it. The "We're Here" slid, as it were, into long, sunk
avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they
would only stay still; but they changed without rest or mercy, and
flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand grey hills, while
the wind hooted through her rigging as she zigzagged down the slopes.
Far away a sea would burst in a sheet of foam, and the others would
follow suit as at a signal, till Harvey's eyes swam with the vision of
interlacing whites and greys. Four or five Mother Carey's chickens
stormed round in circles, shrieking as they swept past the bows. A
rain-squall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste, ran down
wind and back again, and melted away.

"'Seems to me I saw somethin' flicker jest naow over yonder," said
Uncle Salters, pointing to the northeast.

"Can't be any of the fleet," said Disko, peering under his eyebrows, a
hand on the fo'c'sle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the
troughs. "Sea's oilin' over dretful fast. Danny, don't you want to skip
up a piece an' see how aour trawl-buoy lays?"

Danny, in his big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main
rigging (this consumed Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the
reeling crosstrees, and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black
buoy-flag on the shoulder of a mile-away swell.

"She's all right," he hailed. "Sail O! Dead to the no'th'ard, comin'
down like smoke! Schooner she be, too."

They waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a
flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of
olive-green water. Then a stump-foremast lifted, ducked, and
disappeared, to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with
old-fashioned wooden snail's-horn davits. The sails were red-tanned.

"Frenchmen!" shouted Dan. "No, 'tain't, neither. Da-ad!"

"That's no French," said Disko. "Salters, your blame luck holds
tighter'n a screw in a keg-head."

"I've eyes. It's Uncle Abishai."

"You can't nowise tell fer sure."

"The head-king of all Jonahs," groaned Tom Platt. "Oh, Salters,
Salters, why wasn't you abed an' asleep?

"How could I tell?" said poor Salters, as the schooner swung up.

She might have been the very Flying Dutchman, so foul, draggled, and
unkempt was every rope and stick aboard. Her old-style quarter-deck was
some four or five feet high, and her rigging flew knotted and tangled
like weed at a wharf-end. She was running before the wind--yawing
frightfully--her staysail let down to act as a sort of extra
foresail,--"scandalised," they call it,--and her fore-boom guyed out
over the side. Her bowsprit cocked up like an old-fashioned frigate's;
her jib-boom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond
further repair; and as she hove herself forward, and sat down on her
broad tail, she looked for all the world like a blowzy, frousy, bad old
woman sneering at a decent girl.

"That's Abishai," said Salters. "Full o' gin an' Judique men, an' the
judgments o' Providence layin' fer him an' never takin' good holt. He's
run in to bait, Miquelon way."

"He'll run her under," said Long Jack. "That's no rig fer this weather."

"Not he, 'r he'd 'a' done it long ago," Disko replied. "Looks's if he
cal'lated to run us under. Ain't she daown by the head more'n natural,
Tom Platt?"

"Ef it's his style o' loadin' her she ain't safe," said the sailor,
slowly. "Ef she's spewed her oakum he'd better git to his pumps mighty
quick."

The creature thrashed up, wore round with a clatter and rattle, and lay
head to wind within ear-shot.

A greybeard wagged over the bulwark, and a thick voice yelled something
Harvey could not understand. But Disko's face darkened. "He'd resk
every stick he hez to carry bad news. Says we're in fer a shift o'
wind. He's in fer worse. Abishai! Abishai!" He waved his arm up and
down with the gesture of a man at the pumps, and pointed forward. The
crew mocked him and laughed.

"Jounce ye, an' strip ye, an' trip ye!" yelled Uncle Abishai. "A livin'
gale--a livin' gale. Yah! Cast up fer your last trip, all you
Gloucester haddocks. You won't see Gloucester no more, no more!"

"Crazy full--as usual," said Tom Platt. "Wish he hadn't spied us,
though."

She drifted out of hearing while the greyhead yelled something about a
dance at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the fo'c'sle. Harvey
shuddered. He had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savage-eyed crew.

"An' that's a fine little floatin' hell fer her draught," said Long
Jack. "I wondher what mischief he's been at ashore."

"He's a trawler," Dan explained to Harvey, "an' he runs in fer bait all
along the coast. Oh, no, not home, he don't go. He deals along the
south an' east shore up yonder." He nodded in the direction of the
pitiless Newfoundland beaches. "Dad won't never take me ashore there.
They're a mighty tough crowd--an' Abishai's the toughest. You saw his
boat? Well, she's nigh seventy year old, they say; the last o' the old
Marblehead heel-tappers. They don't make them quarter-decks any more.
Abishai don't use Marblehead, though. He ain't wanted there. He jes'
drif's araound, in debt, trawlin' an' cussin' like you've heard. Bin a
Jonah fer years an' years, he hez. 'Gits liquor frum the Feecamp boats
fer makin' spells an' selling winds an' such truck. Crazy, I guess."

"Twon't be any use underrunnin' the trawl to-night," said Tom Platt,
with quiet despair. "He come alongside special to cuss us. I'd give my
wage an' share to see him at the gangway o' the old Ohio 'fore we quit
floggin'. Jest abaout six dozen, an' Sam Mocatta layin' 'em on
crisscross!"

The dishevelled "heel-tapper" danced drunkenly down wind, and all eyes
followed her. Suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice: "It wass
his own death made him speak so! He iss fey--fey, I tell you! Look!"
She sailed into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant.
The patch dulled and faded out, and even as the light passed so did the
schooner. She dropped into a hollow and--was not.

"Run under, by the great hook-block!" shouted Disko, jumping aft.
"Drunk or sober, we've got to help 'em. Heave short and break her out!
Smart!"

Harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of
the jib and foresail, for they hove short on the cable, and to save
time, jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom, heaving in as they
moved away. This is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in
matters of life and death, and the little "We're Here" complained like
a human. They ran down to where Abishai's craft had vanished; found two
or three trawl-tubs, a gin-bottle, and a stove-in dory, but nothing
more. "Let 'em go," said Disko, though no one had hinted at picking
them up. "I wouldn't hev a match that belonged to Abishai aboard.
'Guess she run clear under. 'Must ha' been spewin' her oakum fer a
week, an' they never thought to pump her. That's one more boat gone
along o' leavin' port all hands drunk."

"Glory be!" said Long Jack. "We'd ha' been obliged to help 'em if they
was top o' water."

"'Thinkin' o' that myself," said Tom Platt.

"Fey! Fey!" said the cook, rolling his eyes. "He hass taken his own
luck with him."

"Ver' good thing, I think, to tell the fleet when we see. Eh, wha-at'?"
said Manuel. "If you runna that way before the wind, and she work open
her seams--" He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture,
while Penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and
pity of it all. Harvey could not realise that he had seen death on the
open waters, but he felt very sick.

Then Dan went up the crosstrees, and Disko steered them back to within
sight of their own trawl-buoys just before the fog blanketed the sea
once again.

"We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go," was all he said to
Harvey. "You think on that for a spell, young feller. That was liquor."

After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks,--Penn and Uncle
Salters were very zealous this time,--and the catch was large and large
fish.

"Abishai has shorely took his luck with him," said Salters. "The wind
hain't backed ner riz ner nothin'. How abaout the trawl? I despise
superstition, anyway."

Tom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a
new berth. But the cook said: "The luck iss in two pieces. You will
find it so when you look. I know." This so tickled Long Jack that he
overbore Tom Platt, and the two went out together.

Underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory,
picking off the fish, rebaiting the hooks, and passing them back to the
sea again something like pinning and unpinning linen on a wash-line. It
is a lengthy business and rather dangerous, for the long, sagging line
may twitch a boat under in a flash. But when they heard, "And naow to
thee, O Capting," booming out of the fog, the crew of the "We're Here"
took heart. The dory swirled alongside well loaded, Tom Platt yelling
for Manuel to act as relief-boat.

"The luck's cut square in two pieces," said Long Jack, forking in the
fish, while Harvey stood open-mouthed at the skill with which the
plunging dory was saved from destruction. "One half was jest punkins.
Tom Platt wanted to haul her an' ha' done wid ut; but I said, 'I'll
back the doctor that has the second sight,' an' the other half come up
sagging full o' big uns. Hurry, Man'nle, an' bring's a tub o' bait.
There's luck afloat tonight."

The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had
just been taken, and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and
down the length of the trawl, the boat's nose surging under the wet
line of hooks, stripping the sea-cucumbers that they called pumpkins,
slatting off the fresh-caught cod against the gunwale, rebaiting, and
loading Manuel's dory till dusk.

"I'll take no risks," said Disko, then--"not with him floatin' around
so near. Abishai won't sink fer a week. Heave in the dories, an' we'll
dressdaown after supper."

That was a mighty dressing-down, attended by three or four blowing
grampuses. It lasted till nine o'clock, and Disko was thrice heard to
chuckle as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold.

"Say, you're haulin' ahead dretful fast," said Dan, when they ground
the knives after the men had turned in. "There's somethin' of a sea
tonight, an' I hain't heard you make no remarks on it."

"Too busy," Harvey replied, testing a blade's edge. "Come to think of
it, she is a high-kicker."

The little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the
silver-tipped waves. Backing with a start of affected surprise at the
sight of the strained cable, she pounced on it like a kitten, while the
spray of her descent burst through the hawse-holes with the report of a
gun. Shaking her head, she would say: "Well, I'm sorry I can't stay any
longer with you. I'm going North," and would sidle off, halting
suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging. "As I was just going to
observe," she would begin, as gravely as a drunken man addressing a
lamp-post. The rest of the sentence (she acted her words in dumb-show,
of course) was lost in a fit of the fidgets, when she behaved like a
puppy chewing a string, a clumsy woman in a side-saddle, a hen with her
head cut off, or a cow stung by a hornet, exactly as the whims of the
sea took her.

"See her sayin' her piece. She's Patrick Henry naow," said Dan.

She swung sideways on a roller, and gesticulated with her jib-boom from
port to starboard.

"But-ez---fer-me, give me liberty--er give me-death!"

Wop! She sat down in the moon-path on the water, courtesying with a
flourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheel-gear sniggered
mockingly in its box.

Harvey laughed aloud. "Why, it's just as if she was alive," he said.

"She's as stiddy as a haouse an' as dry as a herrin'," said Dan,
enthusiastically, as he was stung across the deck in a batter of spray.
"Fends 'em off an 'fends 'em off, an' 'Don't ye come anigh me,' she
sez. Look at her--jest look at her! Sakes! You should see one o' them
toothpicks h'istin' up her anchor on her spike outer fifteen-fathom
water."

"What's a toothpick, Dan?"

"Them new haddockers an' herrin'-boats. Fine's a yacht forward, with
yacht sterns to 'em, an' spike bowsprits, an' a haouse that u'd take
our hold. I've heard that Burgess himself he made the models fer three
or four of 'em, Dad's sot ag'in' 'em on account o' their pitchin' an'
joltin', but there's heaps o' money in 'em. Dad can find fish, but he
ain't no ways progressive--he don't go with the march o' the times.
They're chock-full o' labour-savin' jigs an' sech all. 'Ever seed the
Elector o' Gloucester? She's a daisy, ef she is a toothpick."

"What do they cost, Dan?"

"Hills o' dollars. Fifteen thousand, p'haps; more, mebbe. There's
gold-leaf an' everything you kin think of." Then to himself, half under
his breath "Guess I'd call her Hattie S., too."



CHAPTER V

That was the first of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he would
transfer his dory's name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker.
Harvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a
lock of her hair--which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had
"hooked" as she sat in front of him at school that winter--and a
photograph. Hattie was about fourteen years old, with an awful contempt
for boys, and had been trampling on Dan's heart through the winter. All
this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks, in the
dead dark, or in choking fog; the whining wheel behind them, the
climbing deck before, and without, the unresting, clamorous sea. Once,
of course, as the boys came to know each other, there was a fight,
which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them, but
promised not to tell Disko, who thought fighting on watch rather worse
than sleeping. Harvey was no match for Dan physically, but it says a
great deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try
to get even with his conqueror by underhand methods.

That was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his
elbows and wrists, where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the
flesh. The salt water stung them unpleasantly, but when they were ripe
Dan treated them with Disko's razor, and assured Harvey that now he was
a "blooded Banker"; the affliction of gurry-sores being the mark of the
caste that claimed him.

Since he was a boy and very busy, he did not bother his head with too
much thinking. He was exceedingly sorry for his mother, and often
longed to see her and above all to tell her of his wonderful new life,
and how brilliantly he was acquitting himself in it. Otherwise he
preferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his
supposed death. But one day, as he stood on the fo'c'sle ladder, guying
the cook, who had accused him and Dan of hooking fried pies, it
occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by
strangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner.

He was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the "We're Here";
had his place at the table and among the bunks; and could hold his own
in the long talks on stormy days, when the others were always ready to
listen to what they called his "fairy-tales" of his life ashore. It did
not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke
of his own life--it seemed very far away--no one except Dan (and even
Dan's belief was sorely tried) credited him. So he invented a friend, a
boy he had heard of, who drove a miniature four-pony drag in Toledo,
Ohio, and ordered five suits of clothes at a time, and led things
called "germans" at parties where the oldest girl was not quite
fifteen, but all the presents were solid silver. Salters protested that
this kind of yarn was desperately wicked, if not indeed positively
blasphemous, but he listened as greedily as the others; and their
criticisms at the end gave Harvey entirely new notions on "germans,"
clothes, cigarettes with gold-leaf tips, rings, watches, scent, small
dinner-parties, champagne, card-playing, and hotel accommodation.
Little by little he changed his tone when speaking of his "friend,"
whom Long Jack had christened "the Crazy Kid," "the Gilt-edged Baby,"
"the Suckin' Vanderpoop," and other pet names; and with his sea-booted
feet cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk
pajamas and specially imported neckwear, to the "friend's" discredit.
Harvey was a very adaptable person, with a keen eye and ear for every
face and tone about him.

Before long he knew where Disko kept the old green-crusted quadrant
that they called the "hog-yoke"--under the bed-bag in his bunk. When he
'took the sun, and with the help of "The Old Farmer's" almanac found
the latitude, Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the
reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the
chief engineer of the liner could have done no more, and no engineer of
thirty years' service could have assumed one half of the
ancient-mariner air with which Harvey, first careful to spit over the
side, made public the schooner's position for that day, and then and
not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There is an etiquette in
all these things.

The said "hog-yoke," an Eldridge chart, the farming almanac, Blunt's
"Coast Pilot," and Bowditch's "Navigator" were all the weapons Disko
needed to guide him, except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye.
Harvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to
"fly the blue pigeon"; and, though his strength was not equal to
continuous sounding in any sort of a sea, for calm weather with a
seven-pound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely. As Dan said:
"'Tain't soundin's dad wants. It's samples. Grease her up good, Harve."
Harvey would tallow the cup at the end, and carefully bring the sand,
shell, sludge, or whatever it might be, to Disko, who fingered and
smelt it and gave judgment. As has been said, when Disko thought of cod
he thought as a cod; and by some long-tested mixture of instinct and
experience, moved the "We're Here" from berth to berth, always with the
fish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves on the unseen board.

But Disko's board was the Grand Bank--a triangle two hundred and fifty
miles on each side a waste of wallowing sea, cloaked with dank fog,
vexed with gales, harried with drifting ice, scored by the tracks of
the reckless liners, and dotted with the sails of the fishing-fleet.

For days they worked in fog--Harvey at the bell--till, grown familiar
with the thick airs, he went out with Tom Platt, his heart rather in
his mouth. But the fog would not lift, and the fish were biting, and no
one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time. Harvey devoted
himself to his lines and the gaff or gob-stick as Tom Platt called for
them; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and Tom's
instinct; Manuel's conch sounding thin and faint beside them. But it
was an unearthly experience, and, for the first time in a month, Harvey
dreamed of the shifting, smoking floors of water round the dory, the
lines that strayed away into nothing, and the air above that melted on
the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes. A few days later he was
out with Manuel on what should have been forty-fathom bottom, but the
whole length of the roding ran out, and still the anchor found nothing,
and Harvey grew mortally afraid, for that his last touch with earth was
lost. "Whale-hole," said Manuel, hauling in. "That is good joke on
Disko. Come!" and he rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the
others jeering at the skipper because, for once, he had led them to the
edge of the barren Whale-deep, the blank hole of the Grand Bank. They
made another berth through the fog, and that time the hair of Harvey's
head stood up when he went out in Manuel's dory. A whiteness moved in
the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave,
and there was a roaring, a plunging, and spouting. It was his first
introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks, and he cowered in
the bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed. There were days, though,
clear and soft and warm, when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf
over the hand-lines and spank the drifting "sun-scalds" with an oar;
and there were days of light airs, when Harvey was taught how to steer
the schooner from one berth to another.

It thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his hand
on the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed
back and forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of
Disko saying that it would break a snake's back to follow his wake.
But, as usual, pride ran before a fall. They were sailing on the wind
with the staysail--an old one, luckily--set, and Harvey jammed her
right into it to show Dan how completely he had mastered the art. The
foresail went over with a bang, and the foregaff stabbed and ripped
through the stay-sail, which, was of course, prevented from going over
by the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful silence, and Harvey
spent his leisure hours for the next few days under Tom Platt's lee,
learning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he
said, he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days.

Boylike, Harvey imitated all the men by turns, till he had combined
Disko's peculiar stoop at the wheel, Long Jack's swinging overhand when
the lines were hauled, Manuel's round-shouldered but effective stroke
in a dory, and Tom Platt's generous Ohio stride along the deck.

"'Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut," said Long Jack, when Harvey
was looking out by the windlass one thick noon. "I'll lay my wage an'
share 'tis more'n half play-actin' to him, an' he consates himself he's
a bowld mariner. 'Watch his little bit av a back now!"

"That's the way we all begin," said Tom Platt. "The boys they make
believe all the time till they've cheated 'emselves into bein' men, an'
so till they die--pretendin' an' pretendin'. I done it on the old Ohio,
I know. Stood my first watch--harbor-watch--feelin' finer'n Farragut.
Dan's full o' the same kind o' notions. See 'em now, actin' to be
genewine moss-backs--every hair a rope-yarn an' blood Stockholm tar."
He spoke down the cabin stairs. "'Guess you're mistook in your
judgments fer once, Disko. What in Rome made ye tell us all here the
kid was crazy?"

"He wuz," Disko replied. "Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard; but I'll
say he's sobered up consid'ble sence. I cured him."

"He yarns good," said Tom Platt. "T'other night he told us abaout a kid
of his own size steerin' a cunnin' little rig an' four ponies up an'
down Toledo, Ohio, I think 'twas, an' givin' suppers to a crowd o'
sim'lar kids. Cur'us kind o' fairy-tale, but blame interestin'. He
knows scores of 'em."

"'Guess he strikes 'em outen his own head," Disko called from the
cabin, where he was busy with the log-book. "'Stands to reason that
sort is all made up. It don't take in no one but Dan, an' he laughs at
it. I've heard him, behind my back."

"Y'ever hear what Sim'on Peter Ca'houn said when they whacked up a
match 'twix' his sister Hitty an' Lorin' Jerauld, an' the boys put up
that joke on him daown to Georges?" drawled Uncle Salters, who was
dripping peaceably under the lee of the starboard dory-nest.

Tom Platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence: he was a Cape Cod
man, and had not known that tale more than twenty years. Uncle Salters
went on with a rasping chuckle:

"Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he said, an' he was jest right, abaout Lorin',
'Ha'af on the taown,' he said, 'an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' they
told me she's married a 'ich man.' Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he hedn't no
roof to his mouth, an' talked that way."

"He didn't talk any Pennsylvania Dutch," Tom Platt replied. "You'd
better leave a Cape man to tell that tale. The Ca'houns was gipsies
frum 'way back."

"Wal, I don't profess to be any elocutionist," Salters said. "I'm
comin' to the moral o' things. That's jest abaout what aour Harve be!
Ha'af on the taown, an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' there's some'll
believe he's a rich man. Yah!"

"Did ye ever think how sweet 'twould be to sail wid a full crew o'
Salterses?" said Long Jack. "Ha'af in the furrer an' other ha'af in the
muck-heap, as Ca'houn did not say, an' makes out he's a fisherman!"

A little laugh went round at Salters's expense.

Disko held his tongue, and wrought over the log-book that he kept in a
hatchet-faced, square hand; this was the kind of thing that ran on,
page after soiled page:

"July 17. This day thick fog and few fish. Made berth to northward. So
ends this day.

"July 18. This day comes in with thick fog. Caught a few fish.

"July 19. This day comes in with light breeze from N. E. and fine
weather. Made a berth to eastward. Caught plenty fish.

"July 20. This, the Sabbath, comes in with fog and light winds. So ends
this day. Total fish caught this week, 3,478."

They never worked on Sundays, but shaved, and washed themselves if it
were fine, and Pennsylvania sang hymns. Once or twice he suggested
that, if it was not an impertinence, he thought he could preach a
little. Uncle Salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion,
reminding him that he was not a preacher and mustn't think of such
things. We'd hev him rememberin' Johnstown next," Salters explained,
"an' what would happen then?" So they compromised on his reading aloud
from a book called "Josephus." It was an old leather-bound volume,
smelling of a hundred voyages, very solid and very like the Bible, but
enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges; and they read it nearly
from cover to cover. Otherwise Penn was a silent little body. He would
not utter a word for three days on end sometimes, though he played
checkers, listened to the songs, and laughed at the stories. When they
tried to stir him up, he would answer. "I don't wish to seem
unneighbourly, but it is because I have nothing to say. My head feels
quite empty. I've almost forgotten my name." He would turn to Uncle
Salters with an expectant smile.

"Why, Pennsylvania Pratt," Salters would shout. "You'll fergit me next!"

"No--never," Penn would say, shutting his lips firmly. "Pennsylvania
Pratt, of course," he would repeat over and over. Sometimes it was
Uncle Salters who forgot, and told him he was Haskins or Rich or
McVitty; but Penn was equally content--till next time.

He was always very tender with Harvey, whom he pitied both as a lost
child and as a lunatic; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy,
he relaxed, too. Salters was not an amiable person (he esteemed it his
business to keep the boys in order); and the first time Harvey, in fear
and trembling, on a still day, managed to shin up to the main-truck
(Dan was behind him ready to help), he esteemed it his duty to hang
Salters's big sea-boots up there--a sight of shame and derision to the
nearest schooner. With Disko, Harvey took no liberties; not even when
the old man dropped direct orders, and treated him, like the rest of
the crew, to "Don't you want to do so and so?" and "Guess you'd
better," and so forth. There was something about the clean-shaven lips
and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to
young blood.

Disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart, which,
he said, laid over any government publication whatsoever; led him,
pencil in hand, from berth to berth over the whole string of banks--Le
Have, Western, Banquereau, St. Pierre, Green, and Grand--talking "cod"
meantime. Taught him, too, the principle on which the "hog-yoke" was
worked.

In this Harvey excelled Dan, for he had inherited a head for figures,
and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen
Bank sun appealed to all his keen wits. For other sea-matters his age
handicapped him. As Disko said, he should have begun when he was ten.
Dan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark; and at
a pinch, when Uncle Salters had a gurry-sore on his palm, could dress
down by sense of touch. He could steer in anything short of half a gale
from the feel of the wind on his face, humouring the "We're Here" just
when she needed it. These things he did as automatically as he skipped
about the rigging, or made his dory a part of his own will and body.
But he could not communicate his knowledge to Harvey.

Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the
schooner on stormy days, when they lay up in the fo'c'sle or sat on the
cabin lockers, while spare eye-bolts, leads, and rings rolled and
rattled in the pauses of the talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in
the Fifties; of great she-whales slain beside their young; of death
agonies on the black, tossing seas, and blood that spurted forty feet
in the air; of boats smashed to splinters; of patent rockets that went
off wrong-end-first and bombarded the trembling crews; of cutting-in
and boiling-down, and that terrible "nip" of '71, when twelve hundred
men were made homeless on the ice in three days--wonderful tales, all
true. But more wonderful still were his stories of the cod, and how
they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below
the keel.

Long Jack's tastes ran more to the supernatural. He held them silent
with ghastly stories of the "Yo-hoes" on Monomoy Beach, that mock and
terrify lonely clam-diggers; of sand-walkers and dune-haunters who were
never properly buried; of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the
spirits of Kidd's men; of ships that sailed in the fog straight over
Truro township; of that harbour in Maine where no one but a stranger
will lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who
row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their
old-fashioned boat, whistling--not calling, but whistling--for the soul
of the man who broke their rest.

Harvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land, from Mount
Desert south, was populated chiefly by people who took their horses
there in the summer and entertained in country-houses with hardwood
floors and Vantine portieres. He laughed at the ghost-tales,--not as
much as he would have done a month before,--but ended by sitting still
and shuddering.

Tom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old
Ohio in the flogging days, with a navy more extinct than the dodo--the
navy that passed away in the great war. He told them how red-hot shot
are dropped into a cannon, a wad of wet clay between them and the
cartridge; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood, and how the
little ship-boys of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted
to the fort to try again. And he told tales of blockade--long weeks of
swaying at anchor, varied only by the departure and return of steamers
that had used up their coal (there was no change for the
sailing-ships); of gales and cold--cold that kept two hundred men,
night and day, pounding and chopping at the ice on cable, blocks, and
rigging, when the galley was as red-hot as the fort's shot, and men
drank cocoa by the bucket. Tom Platt had no use for steam. His service
closed when that thing was comparatively new. He admitted that it was a
specious invention in time of peace, but looked hopefully for the day
when sails should come back again on ten-thousand-ton frigates with
hundred-and-ninety-foot booms.

Manuel's talk was slow and gentle--all about pretty girls in Madeira
washing clothes in the dry beds of streams, by moonlight, under waving
bananas; legends of saints, and tales of queer dances or fights away in
the cold Newfoundland baiting-ports. Salters was mainly agricultural;
for, though he read "Josephus" and expounded it, his mission in life
was to prove the value of green manures, and specially of clover,
against every form of phosphate whatsoever. He grew libellous about
phosphates; he dragged greasy "Orange Judd" books from his bunk and
intoned them, wagging his finger at Harvey, to whom it was all Greek.
Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of Salters's
lectures that the boy gave it up, and suffered in polite silence. That
was very good for Harvey.

The cook naturally did not join in these conversations. As a rule, he
spoke only when it was absolutely necessary; but at times a queer gift
of speech descended on him, and he held forth, half in Gaelic, half in
broken English, an hour at a time. He was specially communicative with
the boys, and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would
be Dan's master, and that he would see it. He told them of
mail-carrying in the winter up Cape Breton way, of the dog-train that
goes to Coudray, and of the ram-steamer Arctic, that breaks the ice
between the mainland and Prince Edward Island. Then he told them
stories that his mother had told him, of life far to the southward,
where water never froze; and he said that when he died his soul would
go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving
above. That seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never
seen a palm in his life. Then, too, regularly at each meal, he would
ask Harvey, and Harvey alone, whether the cooking was to his taste; and
this always made the "second half" laugh. Yet they had a great respect
for the cook's judgment, and in their hearts considered Harvey
something of a mascot by consequence.

And while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and
hard health with every gulp of the good air, the "We're Here" went her
ways and did her business on the Bank, and the silvery-grey kenches of
well-pressed fish mounted higher and higher in the hold. No one day's
work was out of the common, but the average days were many and close
together.

Naturally, a man of Disko's reputation was closely watched--"scrowged
upon," Dan called it--by his neighbours, but he had a very pretty knack
of giving them the slip through the curdling, glidy fog-banks. Disko
avoided company for two reasons. He wished to make his own experiments,
in the first place; and in the second, he objected to the mixed
gatherings of a fleet of all nations. The bulk of them were mainly
Gloucester boats, with a scattering from Provincetown, Harwich,
Chatham, and some of the Maine ports, but the crews drew from goodness
knows where. Risk breeds recklessness, and when greed is added there
are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet,
which, like a mob of sheep, is huddled round some unrecognised leader.
"Let the two Jeraulds lead 'em," said Disko. "We're baound to lay among
'em fer a spell on the Eastern Shoals; though ef luck holds, we won't
hev to lay long. Where we are naow, Harve, ain't considered noways good
graound."

"Ain't it?" said Harvey, who was drawing water (he had learned just how
to wiggle the bucket), after an unusually long dressing-down.
"Shouldn't mind striking some poor ground for a change, then."

"All the graound I want to see--don't want to strike her--is Eastern
Point," said Dan. "Say, dad, it looks 's if we wouldn't hev to lay
more'n two weeks on the Shoals. You'll meet all the comp'ny you want
then, Harve. That's the time we begin to work. No reg'lar meals fer no
one then. 'Mug-up when ye're hungry, an' sleep when ye can't keep
awake. Good job you wasn't picked up a month later than you was, or
we'd never ha' had you dressed in shape fer the Old Virgin."

Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a
nest of curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise,
and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there.
But seeing the size of the Virgin (it was one tiny dot), he wondered
how even Disko with the hog-yoke and the lead could find her. He
learned later that Disko was entirely equal to that and any other
business, and could even help others. A big four-by-five blackboard
hung in the cabin, and Harvey never understood the need of it till,
after some blinding thick days, they heard the unmelodious tooting of a
foot-power fog-horn--a machine whose note is as that of a consumptive
elephant.

They were making a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to
save trouble. "Squarerigger bellowin' fer his latitude," said Long
Jack. The dripping red headsails of a bark glided out of the fog, and
the "We're Here" rang her bell thrice, using sea shorthand.

The larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings.

"Frenchman," said Uncle Salters, scornfully. "Miquelon boat from St.
Malo." The farmer had a weatherly sea-eye. "I'm most outer 'baccy, too,
Disko."

"Same here," said Tom Platt. "Hi! Backez vouz--backez vouz! Standez
awayez, you butt-ended mucho-bono! Where you from--St. Malo, eh?"

Ah, ha! Mucho bono! Oui! oui! Clos Poulet--St. Malo! St. Pierre et
Miquelon," cried the other crowd, waving woollen caps and laughing.
Then all together, "Bord! Bord!"

"Bring up the board, Danny. Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch
anywheres, exceptin' America's fairish broadly. Forty-six forty-nine's
good enough fer them; an' I guess it's abaout right, too."

Dan chalked the figures on the board, and they hung it in the
main-rigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark.

"Seems kinder unneighbourly to let 'em swedge off like this," Salters
suggested, feeling in his pockets.

"Hev ye learned French then sence last trip'?" said Disko. "I don't
want no more stone-ballast hove at us 'long o' your calm' Miquelon
boats 'footy cochins,' same's you did off Le Have."

"Harmon Rush he said that was the way to rise 'em. Plain United States
is good enough fer me. We're all dretful short on terbakker. Young
feller, don't you speak French?"

"Oh, yes," said Harvey, valiantly; and he bawled: "Hi! Say! Arretez
vous! Attendez! Nous sommes venant pour tabac."

"Ah, tabac, tabac!" they cried, and laughed again.

"That hit 'em. Let's heave a dory over, anyway," said Tom Platt. "I
don't exactly hold no certificates on French, but I know another lingo
that goes, I guess. Come on, Harve, an' interpret."

The raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the bark's
black side was indescribable. Her cabin was all stuck round with
glaring coloured prints of the Virgin--the Virgin of Newfoundland, they
called her. Harvey found his French of no recognised Bank brand, and
his conversation was limited to nods and grins. But Tom Platt waved his
arms and got along swimmingly. The captain gave him a drink of
unspeakable gin, and the opera-comique crew, with their hairy throats,
red caps, and long knives, greeted him as a brother. Then the trade
began. They had tobacco, plenty of it--American, that had never paid
duty to France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back
to arrange with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his
return the cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the
Frenchman's wheel. It looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom
Platt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of
chewing and smoking tobacco. Then those jovial mariners swung off into
the mist, and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus:

"Par derriere chez ma tante, Il y a un bois joli, Et le rossignol y
chante Et le jour et la nuit... Que donneriez vous, belle, Qui
I'amènerait ici? Je donnerai Québec, Sorel et Saint Denis."

"How was it my French didn't go, and your sign-talk did?" Harvey
demanded when the barter had been distributed among the "We're Heres".

"Sign-talk!" Platt guffawed. "Well, yes, 'twas sign-talk, but a heap
older'n your French, Harve. Them French boats are chock-full o'
Freemasons, an' that's why."

"Are you a Freemason, then?"

"Looks that way, don't it?" said the man-o'war's man, stuffing his
pipe; and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon.



CHAPTER VI

The thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which
some craft loafed about the broad Atlantic. Fishing-boats, as Dan said,
were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their
neighbours; but one expected better things of steamers. That was after
another interesting interview, when they had been chased for three
miles by a big lumbering old cattle-boat, all boarded over on the upper
deck, that smelt like a thousand cattle-pens. A very excited officer
yelled at them through a speaking-trumpet, and she lay and lollopped
helplessly on the water while Disko ran the "We're Here" under her lee
and gave the skipper a piece of his mind. "Where might ye be--eh? Ye
don't deserve to be anywheres. You barn-yard tramps go hoggin' the road
on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours, an'
your eyes in your coffee-cups instid o' in your silly heads."

At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about
Disko's own eyes. "We haven't had an observation for three days. D'you
suppose we can run her blind?" he shouted.

"Wa-al, I can," Disko retorted. "What's come to your lead'? Et it'?
Can't ye smell bottom, or are them cattle too rank?"

"What d'ye feed 'em?" said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness, for
the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him. "They say they fall
off dretful on a v'yage. Dunno as it's any o' my business, but I've a
kind o' notion that oil-cake broke small an' sprinkled--"

"Thunder!" said a cattle-man in a red jersey as he looked over the
side. "What asylum did they let His Whiskers out of?"

"Young feller," Salters began, standing up in the fore-rigging, "let me
tell yeou 'fore we go any further that I've--"

The officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness.
"Excuse me," he said, "but I've asked for my reckoning. If the
agricultural person with the hair will kindly shut his head, the
sea-green barnacle with the wall-eye may perhaps condescend to
enlighten us."

"Naow you've made a show o' me, Salters," said Disko, angrily. He could
not stand up to that particular sort of talk, and snapped out the
latitude and longitude without more lectures.

"'Well, that's a boat-load of lunatics, sure," said the skipper, as he
rang up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the
schooner.

"Of all the blamed fools, next to you, Salters, him an' his crowd are
abaout the likeliest I've ever seen," said Disko as the "We're Here"
slid away. "I was jest givin' him my jedgment on lullsikin' round these
waters like a lost child, an' you must cut in with your fool farmin'.
Can't ye never keep things sep'rate?"

Harvey, Dan, and the others stood back, winking one to the other and
full of joy; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening,
Salters arguing that a cattle-boat was practically a barn on blue
water, and Disko insisting that, even if this were the case, decency
and fisher-pride demanded that he should have kept "things sep'rate."
Long Jack stood it in silence for a time,--an angry skipper makes an
unhappy crew,--and then he spoke across the table after supper:

"Fwhat's the good o' bodderin' fwhat they'll say?" said he.

"They'll tell that tale ag'in' us fer years--that's all," said Disko.
"Oil-cake sprinkled!"

"With salt, o' course," said Salters, impenitent, reading the farming
reports from a week-old New York paper.

"It's plumb mortifyin' to all my feelin's," the skipper went on.

"Can't see ut that way," said Long Jack, the peacemaker. "Look at here,
Disko! Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather c'u'd
ha' met a tramp an', over an' above givin' her her reckonin',--over an'
above that, I say,--c'u'd ha' discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on
the management av steers an' such at sea'? Forgit ut! Av coorse they
will not. 'Twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued.
Double game an' twice runnin'--all to us." Dan kicked Harvey under the
table, and Harvey choked in his cup.

"'Well," said Salters, who felt that his honour had been somewhat
plastered, "I said I didn't know as 'twuz any business o' mine, 'fore I
spoke."

"An' right there," said Tom Platt, experienced in discipline and
etiquette--"right there, I take it, Disko, you should ha' asked him to
stop ef the conversation wuz likely, in your jedgment, to be
anyways--what it shouldn't."

"Dunno but that's so," said Disko, who saw his way to an honourable
retreat from a fit of the dignities.

"'Why, o' course it was so," said Salters, "you bein' skipper here; an'
I'd cheerful hev stopped on a hint--not from any leadin' or conviction,
but fer the sake o' bearin' an example to these two blame boys of
aours."

"Didn't I tell you, Harve, 'twould come araound to us 'fore we'd done'?
Always those blame boys. But I wouldn't have missed the show fer a
half-share in a halibutter," Dan whispered.

"Still, things should ha' been kep' sep'rate," said Disko, and the
light of new argument lit in Salters's eye as he crumbled cut plug into
his pipe.

"There's a power av vartue in keepin' things sep'rate," said Long Jack,
intent on stilling the storm. "That's fwhat Steyning of Steyning and
Hare's f'und when he sent Counahan fer skipper on the Marilla D. Kuhn,
instid o' Cap. Newton that was took with inflam't'ry rheumatism an'
couldn't go. Counahan the Navigator we called him."

"Nick Counahan he never went aboard fer a night 'thout a pond o' rum
somewheres in the manifest," said Tom Platt, playing up to the lead.
"He used to bum araound the c'mission houses to Boston lookin' fer the
Lord to make him captain of a towboat on his merits. Sam Coy, up to
Atlantic Avenoo, give him his board free fer a year or more on account
of his stories. Counahan the Navigator! Tck! Tck! Dead these fifteen
year, ain't he?"

"Seventeen, I guess. He died the year the Caspar McVeagh was built; but
he could niver keep things sep'rate. Steyning tuk him fer the reason
the thief tuk the hot stove--bekaze there was nothin' else that season.
The men was all to the Banks, and Counahan he whacked up an iverlastin'
hard crowd fer crew. Rum! Ye c'u'd ha' floated the Marilla, insurance
and all, in fwhat they stowed aboard her. They lef' Boston Harbour for
the great Grand Bank wid a roarin' nor'wester behind 'em an' all hands
full to the bung. An' the hivens looked after thim, for divil a watch
did they set, an' divil a rope did they lay hand to, till they'd seen
the bottom av a fifteen-gallon cask o' bug-juice. That was about wan
week, so far as Counahan remembered. (If' I c'u'd only tell the tale as
he told ut!) All that whoile the wind blew like ould glory, an' the
Marilla--'twas summer, and they'd give her a foretopmast--struck her
gait and kept ut. Then Counahan tuk the hog-yoke an' thrembled over it
for a whoile, an' made out, betwix' that an' the chart an' the singin'
in his head, that they was to the south'ard o' Sable Island, gettin'
along glorious, but speakin' nothin'. Then they broached another keg,
an' quit speculatin' about anythin' fer another spell. The Marilla she
lay down whin she dropped Boston Light, and she never lufted her
lee-rail up to that time--hustlin' on one an' the same slant. But they
saw no weed, nor gulls, nor schooners; an' prisintly they obsarved
they'd been out a matter o' fourteen days, and they mistrusted the Bank
had suspinded payment. So they sounded, an' got sixty fathom. 'That's
me,' sez Counahan. 'That's me iv'ry time! I've run her slat on the Bank
fer you, an' when we get thirty fathom we'll turn in like little men.
Counahan is the b'y,' sez he. 'Counahan the Navigator!'

"Nex' cast they got ninety. Sez Counahan: 'Either the lead-line's tuk
too stretchin' or else the Bank's sunk.'

"They hauled ut up, bein' just about in that state when ut seemed right
an' reasonable, and sat down on the deck countin' the knots, an'
gettin' her snarled up hijjus. The Marilla she'd struck her gait, and
she hild ut, an' prisintly along come a tramp, an' Counahan spoke her.

"'Hey ye seen any fishin'-boats now?' sez he, quite casual.

"'There's lashin's av them off the Irish coast,' sez the tramp.

"Aah! go shake yerself,' sez Counahan. 'Fwhat have I to do wid the
Irish coast?'

"'Then fwhat are ye doin' here?' sez the tramp.

"'Sufferin' Christianity!' sez Counahan (he always said that whin his
pumps sucked an' he was not feelin' good)--'Sufferin' Christianity!' he
sez, 'where am I at?' "'Thirty-five mile west-sou'west o' Cape Clear,'
sez the tramp, 'if that's any consolation to you.'

"Counahan fetched wan jump, four feet sivin inches, measured by the
cook.

"'Consolation!' sez he, bould ez brass. 'D'ye take me fer a dialect?
Thirty-five mile from Cape Clear, an' fourteen days from Boston Light.
Sufferin' Christianity, 'tis a record, an' by the same token I've a
mother to Skibbereen!' Think av ut! The gall av um! But ye see he could
niver keep things sep'rate.

"The crew was mostly Cork an' Kerry men, barrin' one Marylander that
wanted to go back, but they called him a mutineer, an' they ran the
ould Marilla into Skibbereen, an' they had an illigant time visitin'
around with frinds on the ould sod fer a week. Thin they wint back, an'
it cost 'em two an' thirty days to beat to the Banks again. 'Twas
gettin' on towards fall, and grub was low, so Counahan ran her back to
Boston, wid no more bones to ut."

"And what did the firm say?" Harvey demanded.

"Fwhat could they'? The fish was on the Banks, an' Counahan was at
T-wharf talkin' av his record trip east! They tuk their satisfaction
out av that, an' ut all came av not keepin' the crew and the rum
sep'rate in the first place; an' confusin' Skibbereen wid 'Queereau, in
the second. Counahan the Navigator, rest his sowl! He was an imprompju
citizen!

"Once I was in the Lucy Holmes," said Manuel, in his gentle voice.
"They not want any of her feesh in Gloucester. Eh, wha-at? Give us no
price. So we go across the water, and think to sell to some Fayal man.
Then it blow fresh, and we cannot see well. Eh, wha-at? Then it blow
some more fresh, and we go down below and drive very fast--no one know
where. By-and-by we see a land, and it get some hot. Then come two,
three nigger in a brick. Eh, wha-at? We ask where we are, and they
say--now, what you all think?"

"Grand Canary," said Disko, after a moment. Manuel shook his head,
smiling.

"Blanco," said Tom Platt.

"No. Worse than that. We was below Bezagos, and the brick she was from
Liberia! So we sell our feesh there! Not bad, so? Eh, wha-at?"

"Can a schooner like this go right across to Africa?" said Harvey.

"Go araound the Horn ef there's anythin' worth goin' fer, and the grub
holds aout," said Disko. "My father he run his packet, an' she was a
kind o' pinkey, abaout fifty ton, I guess,--the Rupert,--he run her
over to Greenland's icy mountains the year ha'af our fleet was tryin'
after cod there. An' what's more, he took my mother along with him,--to
show her haow the money was earned, I presoom,--an' they was all iced
up, an' I was born at Disko. Don't remember nothin' abaout it, o'
course. We come back when the ice eased in the spring, but they named
me fer the place. Kinder mean trick to put up on a baby, but we're all
baound to make mistakes in aour lives."

"Sure! Sure!" said Salters, wagging his head. "All baound to make
mistakes, an' I tell you two boys here thet after you've made a
mistake--ye don't make fewer'n a hundred a day--the next best thing's
to own up to it like men."

Long Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except
Disko and Salters, and the incident was closed.

Then they made berth after berth to the northward, the dories out
almost every day, running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in
thirty-to forty-fathom water, and fishing steadily.

It was here Harvey first met the squid, who is one of the best
cod-baits, but uncertain in his moods. They were waked out of their
bunks one black night by yells of "Squid O!" from Salters, and for an
hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squid-jig--a piece of
lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent
backward like half-opened umbrella ribs. The squid--for some unknown
reason--likes, and wraps himself round, this thing, and is hauled up
ere he can escape from the pins. But as he leaves his home he squirts
first water and next ink into his captor's face; and it was curious to
see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot.
They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a pile of fresh
squid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a little
shiny piece of squid-tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next
day they caught many fish, and met the Carrie Pitman, to whom they
shouted their luck, and she wanted to trade--seven cod for one
fair-sized squid; but Disko would not agree at the price, and the
Carrie dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away, in
the hope of striking on to some for herself.

Disko said nothing till after supper, when he sent Dan and Manuel out
to buoy the "We're Here's" cable and announced his intention of turning
in with the broad-axe. Dan naturally repeated these remarks to a dory
from the Carrie, who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable,
since they were not on rocky bottom.

"Dad sez he wouldn't trust a ferryboat within five mile o' you," Dan
howled cheerfully.

"Why don't he git out, then'? Who's hinderin'?" said the other.

"Cause you've jest the same ez lee-bowed him, an' he don't take that
from any boat, not to speak o' sech a driftin' gurry-butt as you be."

"She ain't driftin' any this trip," said the man, angrily, for the
Carrie Pitman had an unsavoury reputation for breaking her
ground-tackle.

"Then haow d'you make berths?" said Dan. "It's her best p'int o'
sailin'. An' ef she's quit driftin', what in thunder are you doin' with
a new jib-boom?" That shot went home.

"Hey, you Portugoosy organ-grinder, take your monkey back to
Gloucester. Go back to school, Dan Troop," was the answer.

"O-ver-alls! O-ver-alls!" yelled Dan, who knew that one of the Carrie's
crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before.

"Shrimp! Gloucester shrimp! Git aout, you Novy!"

To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received. Dan
answered in kind.

"Novy yourself, ye Scrabble-towners! ye Chatham wreckers' Git aout with
your brick in your stock in'!" And the forces separated, but Chatham
had the worst of it.

"I knew haow 'twould be," said Disko. "She's drawed the wind raound
already. Some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet. She'll snore
till midnight, an' jest when we're gittin' our sleep she'll strike
adrift. Good job we ain't crowded with craft hereaways. But I ain't
goin' to up anchor fer Chatham. She may hold."

The wind, which had hauled round, rose at sundown and blew steadily.
There was not enough sea, though, to disturb even a dory's tackle, but
the Carrie Pitman was a law unto herself. At the end of the boys' watch
they heard the crack-crack-crack of a huge muzzle-loading revolver
aboard her.

"Glory, glory, hallelujah!" sung Dan. "Here she comes, dad; butt-end
first, walkin' in her sleep same's she done on 'Queereau."

Had she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances, but now
he cut the cable as the Carrie Pitman, with all the North Atlantic to
play in, lurched down directly upon them. The "We're Here", under jib
and riding-sail, gave her no more room than was absolutely
necessary,--Disko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his
cable,--but scuttled up into the wind as the Carrie passed within easy
hail, a silent and angry boat, at the mercy of a raking broadside of
Bank chaff.

"Good evenin'," said Disko, raising his headgear, "an' haow does your
garden grow?"

"Go to Ohio an' hire a mule," said Uncle Salters. "We don't want no
farmers here."

"Will I lend you my dory-anchor?" cried Long Jack.

"Unship your rudder an' stick it in the mud," said Tom Platt.

"Say!" Dan's voice rose shrill and high, as he stood on the wheel-box.
"Sa-ay! Is there a strike in the o-ver-all factory; or hev they hired
girls, ye Shackamaxons?"

"Veer out the tiller-lines," cried Harvey, "and nail 'em to the
bottom." That was a salt-flavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom
Platt. Manuel leaned over the stern and yelled; "Johnna Morgan play the
organ! Ahaaaa!" He flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of
unspeakable contempt and derision, while little Penn covered himself
with glory by piping up: "Gee a little! Hssh! Come here. Haw!"

They rode on their chain for the rest of the night, a short, snappy,
uneasy motion, as Harvey found, and wasted half the forenoon recovering
the cable. But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of
triumph and glory, and they thought with grief over all the beautiful
things that they might have said to the discomfited Carrie.



CHAPTER VII

Next day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the
east northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make
the shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored,
surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells. There was not much
fishing, but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news.

That night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping
most of the day, tumbled out to "hook" fried pies. There was no reason
why they should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so,
and it made the cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck
with their plunder, and they found Disko at the bell, which he handed
over to Harvey.

"Keep her goin'," said he. "I mistrust I hear somethin'. Ef it's
anything, I'm best where I am so's to get at things."

It was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off;
and in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren,
and he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to
him, with horrible distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured
jersey--he despised fancy blazers now with all a fisherman's
contempt--how an ignorant, rowdy boy had once said it would be "great"
if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy had a state-room with a
hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a
gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy--no, his very much older
brother--was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming, crackling
oilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell smaller
than the steward's breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a
thirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The
bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry,
upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat
before breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.

"Yes, they slow daown one turn o' their blame propeller," said Dan,
applying himself to Manuel's conch, "fer to keep inside the law, an'
that's consolin' when we're all at the bottom. Hark to her' She's a
humper!"

"Aoooo--whoooo--whupp!" went the siren. "Wingle--tingle--tink," went
the bell. "Graaa--ouch!" went the conch, while sea and sky were all
milled up in milky fog. Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving
body, and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a
cliff-like bow, leaping, it seemed, directly over the schooner. A
jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it, and as it lifted
it showed a long ladder of Roman numerals--XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII.,
and so forth--on a salmon-coloured, gleaming side. It tilted forward
and downward with a heart-stilling "Ssssooo"; the ladder disappeared; a
line of brass-rimmed port-holes flashed past; a jet of Steam puffed in
Harvey's helplessly uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along
the rail of the "We're Here", and the little schooner staggered and
shook in a rush of screw-torn water, as a liner's stern vanished in the
fog. Harvey got ready to faint or be sick, or both, when he heard a
crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk, and, all small in his ear, a
far-away telephone voice drawling: "Heave to! You've sunk us!"

"Is it us?" he gasped.

"No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We're goin' to look," said Dan, running out
a dory.

In half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside
and away. Presently a schooner's stump-foremast, snapped clean across,
drifted past the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on
the 'We're Here's' side, as though she wished to be taken in. Then
followed something, face down, in a blue jersey, but it was not the
whole of a man. Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click.
Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell, for he feared they might be
sunk at any minute, and he jumped at Dan's hail as the crew came back.

"The Jennie Cushman," said Dan, hysterically, "cut clean in
half--graound up an' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away.
Dad's got the old man. There ain't any one else, and--there was his
son, too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can't stand it! I've seen--" He dropped
his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a grey-headed
man aboard.

"What did you pick me up for?" the stranger groaned. "Disko, what did
you pick me up for?"

Disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder, for the man's eyes were
wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew. Then up and
spoke Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when
Uncle Salters forgot; and his face was changed on him from the face of
a fool to the countenance of an old, wise man, and he said in a strong
voice: "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
name of the Lord! I was--I am a minister of the Gospel. Leave him to
me."

"Oh, you be, be you?" said the man. "Then pray my son back to me! Pray
back a nine-thousand-dollar boat an' a thousand quintal of fish. If
you'd left me alone my widow could ha' gone on to the Provident an'
worked fer her board, an' never known--an' never known. Now I'll hev to
tell her."

"There ain't nothin' to say," said Disko. "Better lie down a piece,
Jason Olley."

When a man has lost his only son, his summer's work, and his means of
livelihood, in thirty counted seconds, it is hard to give consolation.

"All Gloucester men, wasn't they," said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly
with a dory-becket.

"Oh, that don't make no odds," said Jason, wringing the wet from his
beard. "I'll be rowin' summer boarders araound East Gloucester this
fall." He rolled heavily to the rail, singing.

"Happy birds that sing and fly Round thine altars, O Most High!"

"Come with me. Come below!" said Penn, as though he had a right to give
orders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.

"I dunno who you be, but I'll come," said Jason, submissively. "Mebbe
I'll get back some o' the--some o' the--nine thousand dollars." Penn
led him into the cabin and slid the door behind.

"That ain't Penn," cried Uncle Salters. "It's Jacob Boiler, an'--he's
remembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin' man's head.
What's to do naow? What'll I do naow?"

They could hear Penn's voice and Jason's together. Then Penn's went on
alone, and Salters slipped off his hat, for Penn was praying. Presently
the little man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his face, and
looked at the crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.

"He don't know us," Salters groaned. "It's all to do over again,
checkers and everything--an' what'll he say to me?"

Penn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. "I have prayed,"
said he. "Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of
this man's son. Mine were drowned before my eyes--she and my eldest
and--the others. Shall a man be more wise than his Maker? I prayed
never for their lives, but I have prayed for this man's son, and he
will surely be sent him."

Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered.

"How long have I been mad?" Penn asked suddenly. His mouth was
twitching.

"Pshaw, Penn! You weren't never mad," Salters began. "Only a little
distracted like."

"I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out. I do
not remember any more. How long ago is that?"

"I can't stand it! I can't stand it!" cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered
in sympathy.

"Abaout five year," said Disko, in a shaking voice.

"Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who
was the man?"

Disko pointed to Salters.

"Ye hain't--ye hain't!" cried the sea-farmer, twisting his hands
together. "Ye've more'n earned your keep twice-told; an' there's money
owin' you, Penn, besides ha'af o' my quarter-share in the boat, which
is yours fer value received."

"You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But--"

"Mother av Mercy," whispered Long Jack, "an' he's been wid us all these
trips! He's clean bewitched."

A schooner's bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the
fog: "O Disko! 'Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman?"

"They have found his son," cried Penn. "Stand you still and see the
salvation of the Lord!"

"Got Jason aboard here," Disko answered, but his voice quavered.
"There--warn't any one else?"

"We've f'und one, though. 'Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o'
lumber thet might ha' bin a fo'c'sle. His head's cut some."

"Who is he?"

The "We're Heres'" heart-beats answered one another.

"Guess it's young Olley," the voice drawled.

Penn raised his hands and said something in German. Harvey could have
sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face; but the drawl
went on: "Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid'rable t'other night."

"We don't feel like guyin' any now," said Disko.

"I know it; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder--kinder driftin'
when we run ag'in' young Olley."

It was the irrepressible Carrie Pitman, and a roar of unsteady laughter
went up from the deck of the "We're Here".

"Hedn't you 'baout's well send the old man aboard? We're runnin' in fer
more bait an' graound-tackle. 'Guess you won't want him, anyway, an'
this blame windlass work makes us short-handed. We'll take care of him.
He married my woman's aunt."

"I'll give you anything in the boat," said Troop.

"Don't want nothin', 'less, mebbe, an anchor that'll hold. Say! Young
Olley's gittin' kinder baulky an' excited. Send the old man along."

Penn waked him from his stupor of despair, and Tom Platt rowed him
over. He went away without a word of thanks, not knowing what was to
come; and the fog closed over all.

"And now," said Penn, drawing a deep breath as though about to preach.
"And now"--the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the
scabbard; the light faded from the overbright eyes; the voice returned
to its usual pitiful little titter--"and now," said Pennsylvania
Pratt, "do you think it's too early for a little game of checkers, Mr.
Salters?"

"The very thing--the very thing I was goin' to say myself," cried
Salters, promptly. "It beats all, Penn, how you git on to what's in a
man's mind."

The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward.

"Up anchor! Hurry! Let's quit these crazy waters," shouted Disko, and
never was he more swiftly obeyed.

"Now what in creation d'ye suppose is the meanin' o' that all?" said
Long Jack, when they were working through the fog once more, damp,
dripping, and bewildered.

"The way I sense it," said Disko, at the wheel, "is this: The Jennie
Cushman business comin' on an empty stummick--"

"He--we saw one of them go by," sobbed Harvey.

"An' that, o' course, kinder hove him outer water, Julluk runnin' a
craft ashore; hove him right aout, I take it, to rememberin' Johnstown
an' Jacob Boiler an' such-like reminiscences. Well, consolin' Jason
there held him up a piece, same's shorin' up a boat. Then, bein' weak,
them props slipped an' slipped, an' he slided down the ways, an' naow
he's water-borne ag'in. That's haow I sense it."

They decided that Disko was entirely correct.

"'Twould ha' bruk Salters all up," said Long Jack, "if Penn had stayed
Jacob Bollerin'. Did ye see his face when Penn asked who he'd been
charged on all these years'? How is ut, Salters?"

"Asleep--dead asleep. Turned in like a child," Salters replied,
tiptoeing aft. "There won't be no grub till he wakes, natural. Did ye
ever see sech a gift in prayer? He everlastin'ly hiked young Olley
outer the ocean. Thet's my belief. Jason was tur'ble praoud of his boy,
an' I mistrusted all along 'twas a jedgment on worshippin' vain idols."

"There's others jest as sot," said Disko.

"That's dif'runt," Salters retorted quickly. "Penn's not all caulked,
an' I ain't only but doin' my duty by him."

They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with a
smooth face and a blank mind. He said he believed that he had been
dreaming. Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and they
could not tell him.

Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days; and
when they could not go out, turned them into the hold to stack the
ship's stores into smaller compass, to make more room for the fish. The
packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the
fo'c'sle stove; and Disko showed how there is great art in stowing
cargo so as to bring a schooner to her best draft. The crew were thus
kept lively till they recovered their spirits; and Harvey was tickled
with a rope's end by Long Jack for being, as the Galway man said,
"sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat couldn't be helped." He did a great
deal of thinking in those dreary days; and told Dan what he thought,
and Dan agreed with him--even to the extent of asking for fried pies
instead of hooking them.

But a week later the two nearly upset the Hattie S. in a wild attempt
to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick. The grim brute
rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish, and between the three
of them it was a mercy they all got off alive.

At last, after playing blindman's-buff in the fog, there came a morning
when Disko shouted down the fo'c'sle: "Hurry, boys! We're in taown!"



CHAPTER VIII

To the end of his days, Harvey will never forget that sight. The sun
was just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week, and
his low red light struck into the riding-sails of three fleets of
anchored schooners--one to the north, one to the westward, and one to
the south. There must have been nearly a hundred of them, of every
possible make and build, with, far away, a square-rigged Frenchman, all
bowing and courtesying one to the other. From every boat dories were
dropping away like bees from a crowded hive; and the clamour of voices,
the rattling of ropes and blocks, and the splash of the oars carried
for miles across the heaving water. The sails turned all colours,
black, pearly-grey, and white, as the sun mounted; and more boats swung
up through the mists to the southward.

The dories gathered in clusters, separated, reformed, and broke again,
all heading one way; while men hailed and whistled and cat-called and
sang, and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard.

"It's a town," said Harvey. "Disko was right. It is a town!"

"I've seen smaller," said Disko. "There's about a thousand men here;
an' yonder's the Virgin." He pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea,
where there were no dories.

The "We're Here" skirted round the northern squadron, Disko waving his
hand to friend after friend, and anchored as neatly as a racing yacht
at the end of the season. The Bank fleet pass good seamanship in
silence; but a bungler is jeered all along the line.

"Jest in time fer the caplin," cried the Mary Chilton.

"'Salt 'most wet?" asked the King Philip.

"Hey, Tom Platt! Come t' supper to-night?" said the Henry Clay; and so
questions and answers flew back and forth. Men had met one another
before, dory-fishing in the fog, and there is no place for gossip like
the Bank fleet. They all seemed to know about Harvey's rescue, and
asked if he were worth his salt yet. The young bloods jested with Dan,
who had a lively tongue of his own, and inquired after their health by
the town--nicknames they least liked. Manuel's countrymen jabbered at
him in their own language; and even the silent cook was seen riding the
jib-boom and shouting Gaelic to a friend as black as himself. After
they had buoyed the cable--all around the Virgin is rocky bottom, and
carelessness means chafed ground-tackle and danger from drifting--after
they had buoyed the cable, their dories went forth to join the mob of
boats anchored about a mile away. The schooners rocked and dipped at a
safe distance, like mother ducks watching their brood, while the dories
behaved like mannerless ducklings.

As they drove into the confusion, boat banging boat, Harvey's ears
tingled at the comments on his rowing. Every dialect from Labrador to
Long Island, with Portuguese, Neapolitan, Lingua Franca, French, and
Gaelic, with songs and shoutings and new oaths, rattled round him, and
he seemed to be the butt of it all. For the first time in his life he
felt shy--perhaps that came from living so long with only the "We're
Heres"--among the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the
reeling small craft. A gentle, breathing swell, three furlongs from
trough to barrel, would quietly shoulder up a string of variously
painted dories. They hung for an instant, a wonderful frieze against
the sky-line, and their men pointed and hailed, Next moment the open
mouths, waving arms, and bare chests disappeared, while on another
swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in
a toy theatre. So Harvey stared. "Watch out!" said Dan, flourishing a
dip-net. "When I tell you dip, you dip. The caplin'll school any time
from naow on. Where'll we lay, Tom Platt?"

Pushing, shoving, and hauling, greeting old friends here and warning
old enemies there, Commodore Tom Platt led his little fleet well to
leeward of the general crowd, and immediately three or four men began
to haul on their anchors with intent to lee-bow the "We're Heres". But
a yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with
exceeding speed, its occupant pulling madly on the roding.

"Give her slack!" roared twenty voices. "Let him shake it out."

"What's the matter?" said Harvey, as the boat flashed away to the
southward. "He's anchored, isn't he?"

"Anchored, sure enough, but his graound-tackle's kinder shifty," said
Dan, laughing. "Whale's fouled it. . . . Dip, Harve! Here they come!"

The sea round them clouded and darkened, and then frizzed up in showers
of tiny silver fish, and over a space of five or six acres the cod
began to leap like trout in May; while behind the cod three or four
broad grey-black backs broke the water into boils.

Then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the
school, and fouled his neighbour's line and said what was in his heart,
and dipped furiously with his dip-net, and shrieked cautions and advice
to his companions, while the deep fizzed like freshly opened
soda-water, and cod, men, and whales together flung in upon the
luckless bait. Harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of
Dan's net. But in all the wild tumult he noticed, and never forgot, the
wicked, set little eye--something like a circus elephant's eye--of a
whale that drove along almost level with the water, and, so he said,
winked at him. Three boats found their rodings fouled by these reckless
mid-sea hunters, and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the
line free.

Then the caplin moved off and five minutes later there was no sound
except the splash of the sinkers overside, the flapping of the cod, and
the whack of the muckles as the men stunned them. It was wonderful
fishing. Harvey could see the glimmering cod below, swimming slowly in
droves, biting as steadily as they swam. Bank law strictly forbids more
than one hook on one line when the dories are on the Virgin or the
Eastern Shoals; but so close lay the boats that even single hooks
snarled, and Harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle, hairy
Newfoundlander on one side and a howling Portuguese on the other.

Worse than any tangle of fishing-lines was the confusion of the
dory-rodings below water. Each man had anchored where it seemed good to
him, drifting and rowing round his fixed point. As the fish struck on
less quickly, each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground; but
every third man found himself intimately connected with some four or
five neighbours. To cut another's roding is crime unspeakable on the
Banks; yet it was done, and done without detection, three or four times
that day. Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and knocked him
over the gunwale with an oar, and Manuel served a fellow-countryman in
the same way. But Harvey's anchor-line was cut, and so was Penn's, and
they were turned into relief-boats to carry fish to the "We're Here" as
the dories filled. The caplin schooled once more at twilight, when the
mad clamour was repeated; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by
the light of kerosene-lamps on the edge of the pen.

It was a huge pile, and they went to sleep while they were dressing.
Next day several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin; and
Harvey, with them, looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock,
which rises to within twenty feet of the surface. The cod were there in
legions, marching solemnly over the leathery kelp. When they bit, they
bit all together; and so when they stopped. There was a slack time at
noon, and the dories began to search for amusement. It was Dan who
sighted the Hope of Prague just coming up, and as her boats joined the
company they were greeted with the question: "Who's the meanest man in
the Fleet?"

Three hundred voices answered cheerily:

"Nick Bra-ady." It sounded an organ chant.

"Who stole the lamp-wicks?" That was Dan's contribution.

"Nick Bra-ady," sang the boats.

"Who biled the salt bait fer soup?" This was an unknown backbiter a
quarter of a mile away.

Again the joyful chorus. Now, Brady was not especially mean, but he had
that reputation, and the Fleet made the most of it. Then they
discovered a man from a Truro boat who, six years before, had been
convicted of using a tackle with five or six hooks--a "scrowger," they
call it--on the Shoals. Naturally, he had been christened "Scrowger Jim";
and though he had hidden himself on the Georges ever since, he found
his honours waiting for him full blown. They took it up in a sort of
fire-cracker chorus: "Jim! O Jim! Jim! O Jim! Sssscrowger Jim!" That
pleased everybody. And when a poetical Beverly man--he had been making
it up all day, and talked about it for weeks--sang, "The Carrie
Pitman's anchor doesn't hold her for a cent!" the dories felt that they
were indeed fortunate. Then they had to ask that Beverly man how he was
off for beans, because even poets must not have things all their own
way. Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn. Was there a
careless or dirty cook anywhere? The dories sang about him and his
food. Was a schooner badly found? The Fleet was told at full length.
Had a man hooked tobacco from a messmate? He was named in meeting; the
name tossed from roller to roller. Disko's infallible judgments, Long
Jack's market-boat that he had sold years ago, Dan's sweetheart (oh,
but Dan was an angry boy!), Penn's bad luck with dory-anchors,
Salters's views on manure, Manuel's little slips from virtue ashore,
and Harvey's ladylike handling of the oar--all were laid before the
public; and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the
sun, the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing
sentence.

The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the
sea. Then they drew more apart to save their sides, and some one called
that if the swell continued the Virgin would break. A reckless Galway
man with his nephew denied this, hauled up anchor, and rowed over the
very rock itself. Many voices called them to come away, while others
dared them to hold on. As the smooth-backed rollers passed to the
south-ward, they hove the dory high and high into the mist, and dropped
her in ugly, sucking, dimpled water, where she spun round her anchor,
within a foot or two of the hidden rock. It was playing with death for
mere bravado; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long Jack
rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding.

"Can't ye hear ut knockin'?" he cried. "Pull for your miserable lives!
Pull!"

The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted; but the next
swell checked a little, like a man tripping on a carpet. There was a
deep sob and a gathering roar, and the Virgin flung up a couple of
acres of foaming water, white, furious, and ghastly over the shoal sea.
Then all the boats greatly applauded Long Jack, and the Galway men held
their tongue.

"Ain't it elegant?" said Dan, bobbing like a young seal at home.
"She'll break about once every ha'af hour now, 'less the swell piles up
good. What's her reg'lar time when she's at work, Tom Platt?"

"Once ivry fifteen minutes, to the tick. Harve, you've seen the
greatest thing on the Banks; an' but for Long Jack you'd seen some dead
men too."

There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the
schooners were ringing their bells. A big bark nosed cautiously out of
the mist, and was received with shouts and cries of, "Come along,
darlin'," from the Irishry.

"Another Frenchman?" said Harvey.

"Hain't you eyes? She's a Baltimore boat; goin' in fear an' tremblin',"
said Dan. "We'll guy the very sticks out of her. 'Guess it's the fust
time her skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way."

She was a black, buxom, eight-hundred-ton craft. Her mainsail was
looped up, and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was
moving. Now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea,
and this tall, hesitating creature, with her white and gilt figurehead,
looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a
muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys. That was very much her
situation. She knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
Virgin, had caught the roar of it, and was, therefore, asking her way.
This is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories:

"The Virgin? Fwhat are you talk in' of'? This is Le Have on a Sunday
mornin'. Go home an' sober up."

"Go home, ye tarrapin! Go home an' tell 'em we're comin'."

Half a dozen voices together, in a most tuneful chorus, as her stern
went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs:
"Thay-aah--she--strikes!"

"Hard up! Hard up fer your life! You're on top of her now."

"Daown! Hard daown! Let go everything!"

"All hands to the pumps!"

"Daown jib an' pole her!"

Here the skipper lost his temper and said things. Instantly fishing was
suspended to answer him, and he heard many curious facts about his boat
and her next port of call. They asked him if he were insured; and
whence he had stolen his anchor, because, they said, it belonged to the
Carrie Pitman; they called his boat a mud-scow, and accused him of
dumping garbage to frighten the fish; they offered to tow him and
charge it to his wife; and one audacious youth slipped almost under the
counter, smacked it with his open palm, and yelled: "Gid up, Buck!"

The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him, and he replied with cod-heads.
The bark's crew fired small coal from the galley, and the dories
threatened to come aboard and "razee" her. They would have warned her
at once had she been in real peril; but, seeing her well clear of the
Virgin, they made the most of their chances. The fun was spoilt when
the rock spoke again, a half-mile to windward, and the tormented bark
set everything that would draw and went her ways; but the dories felt
that the honours lay with them.

All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely and next morning, over an
angry, white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts
waiting for a lead. Not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock, when the
two Jeraulds of the Day's Eye, imagining a lull which did not exist,
set the example. In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the
cockly swells, but Troop kept the "We're Heres" at work dressing-down.
He saw no sense in "dares"; and as the storm grew that evening they had
the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any
refuge in the gale. The boys stood by the dory-tackles with lanterns,
the men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would
make them drop everything and hold on for the dear life. Out of the
dark would come a yell of "Dory, dory!" They would hook up and haul in
a drenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered
down with nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their
watch did Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on
the boom, and cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and
sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to
pieces, and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks, cutting
his forehead open; and about dawn, when the racing seas glimmered white
all along their cold edges, another man, blue and ghastly, crawled in
with a broken hand, asking news of his brother. Seven extra mouths sat
down to breakfast: a Swede; a Chatham skipper; a boy from Hancock,
Maine; one Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.

There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day; and though no
one said anything, all ate with better appetites when boat after boat
reported full crews aboard. Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man
from Gloucester were drowned, but many were cut or bruised; and two
schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward,
three days' sail. A man died on a Frenchman--it was the same bark that
had traded tobacco with the "We're Heres". She slipped away quite
quietly one wet, white morning, moved to a patch of deep water, her
sails all hanging anyhow, and Harvey saw the funeral through Disko's
spy-glass. It was only an oblong bundle slid overside. They did not
seem to have any form of service, but in the night, at anchor, Harvey
heard them across the star-powdered black water, singing something that
sounded like a hymn. It went to a very slow tune.

La brigantine Qui va tourner, Roule et s'incline Pour m'entrainer. Oh,
Vierge Marie, Pour moi priez Dieu! Adieu, patrie; Québec, adieu!

Tom Platt visited her, because, he said, the dead man was his brother
as a Freemason. It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow
over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back. The news spread like
a flash, for, contrary to general custom, the Frenchman held an auction
of the dead man's kit,--he had no friends at St. Malo or Miquelon,--and
everything was spread out on the top of the house, from his red knitted
cap to the leather belt with the sheath-knife at the back. Dan and
Harvey were out on twenty-fathom water in the Hattie S., and naturally
rowed over to join the crowd. It was a long pull, and they stayed some
little time while Dan bought the knife, which had a curious brass
handle. When they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of
rain and a lop of sea, it occurred to them that they might get into
trouble for neglecting the lines. "Guess 'twon't hurt us any to be
warmed up," said Dan, shivering under his oilskins, and they rowed on
into the heart of a white fog, which, as usual, dropped on them without
warning.

"There's too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks," he
said. "Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we'll fish a piece till the
thing lifts. Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain't any too much
in this water. See how she's tightened on her rodin' already."

There was quite a little bubble at the bows, where some irresponsible
Bank current held the dory full stretch on her rope; but they could not
see a boat's length in any direction. Harvey turned up his collar and
bunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator. Fog
had no special terrors for him now. They fished awhile in silence, and
found the cod struck on well. Then Dan drew the sheath-knife and tested
the edge of it on the gunwale.

"That's a daisy," said Harvey. "How did you get it so cheap?"

"On account o' their blame Cath'lic superstitions," said Dan, jabbing
with the bright blade. "They don't fancy takin' iron frum off of a dead
man, so to speak. 'See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid?"

"But an auction ain't taking anything off a dead man. It's business."

"We know it ain't, but there's no goin' in the teeth o' superstition.
That's one o' the advantages o' livin' in a progressive country." And
Dan began whistling:

"Oh, Double Thatcher, how are you? Now Eastern Point comes inter view.
The girls an' boys we soon shall see, At anchor off Cape Ann!"

"Why didn't that Eastport man bid, then? He bought his boots. Ain't
Maine progressive?"

"Maine? Pshaw! They don't know enough, or they hain't got money enough,
to paint their haouses in Maine. I've seen 'em. The Eastport man he
told me that the knife had been used--so the French captain told
him--used up on the French coast last year."

"Cut a man? Heave's the muckle." Harvey hauled in his fish, rebaited,
and threw over.

"Killed him! 'Course, when I heard that I was keener 'n ever to get it."

"Christmas! I didn't know it," said Harvey, turning round. "I'll give
you a dollar for it when I--get my wages. Say, I'll give you two
dollars."

"Honest? D'you like it as much as all that?" said Dan, flushing. "Well,
to tell the truth, I kinder got it for you--to give; but I didn't let
on till I saw how you'd take it. It's yours and welcome, Harve, because
we're dory-mates, and so on and so forth, an' so followin'. Catch
a-holt!"

He held it out, belt and all.

"But look at here. Dan, I don't see--"

"Take it. 'Tain't no use to me. I wish you to hev it."

The temptation was irresistible. "Dan, you're a white man," said
Harvey. "I'll keep it as long as I live."

"That's good hearin'," said Dan, with a pleasant laugh; and then,
anxious to change the subject: "Look's if your line was fast to
somethin'."

"Fouled, I guess," said Harve, tugging. Before he pulled up he fastened
the belt round him, and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath
click on the thwart. "Concern the thing!" he cried. "She acts as though
she were on strawberry-bottom. It's all sand here, ain't it'?"

Dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak. "Holibut'll act that way
'f he's sulky. Thet's no strawberry-bottom. Yank her once or twice. She
gives, sure. 'Guess we'd better haul up an' make certain."

They pulled together, making fast at each turn on the cleats, and the
hidden weight rose sluggishly.

"Prize, oh! Haul!" shouted Dan, but the shout ended in a shrill, double
shriek of horror, for out of the sea came--the body of the dead
Frenchman buried two days before! The hook had caught him under the
right armpit, and he swayed, erect and horrible, head and shoulders
above water. His arms were tied to his side, and--he had no face. The
boys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory, and
there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside, held on the shortened
line.

"The tide--the tide brought him!" said Harvey, with quivering lips, as
he fumbled at the clasp of the belt.

"Oh, Lord! Oh, Harve!" groaned Dan, "be quick. He's come for it. Let
him have it. Take it off."

"I don't want it! I don't want it!" cried Harvey. "I can't find the
bu-buckle."

"Quick, Harve! He's on your line!"

Harvey sat up to unfasten the belt, facing the head that had no face
under its streaming hair. "He's fast still," he whispered to Dan, who
slipped out his knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far
overside. The body shot down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to
his knees, whiter than the fog.

"He come for it. He come for it. I've seen a stale one hauled up on a
trawl and I didn't much care, but he come to us special."

"I wish--I wish I hadn't taken the knife. Then he'd have come on your
line."

"Dunno as thet would ha' made any differ. We're both scared out o' ten
years' growth. Oh, Harve, did ye see his head?"

"Did I'? I'll never forget it. But look at here, Dan; it couldn't have
been meant. It was only the tide."

"Tide! He come for it, Harve. Why, they sunk him six mile to south'ard
o' the Fleet, an' we're two miles from where she's lyin' now. They told
me he was weighted with a fathom an' a half o' chain-cable."

"Wonder what he did with the knife--up on the French coast?"

"Something bad. 'Guess he's bound to take it with him to the Judgment,
an' so--What are you doin' with the fish?"

"Heaving 'em overboard," said Harvey.

"What for? We sha'n't eat 'em."

"I don't care. I had to look at his face while I was takin' the belt
off. You can keep your catch if you like. I've no use for mine."

Dan said nothing, but threw his fish over again.

"'Guess it's best to be on the safe side," he murmured at last. "I'd
give a month's pay if this fog 'u'd lift. Things go abaout in a fog
that ye don't see in clear weather--yo-hoes an' hollerers and such
like. I'm sorter relieved he come the way he did instid o' walkin'. He
might ha' walked."

"Do-on't, Dan! We're right on top of him now. 'Wish I was safe aboard,
bein' pounded by Uncle Salters."

"They'll be lookin' fer us in a little. Gimme the tooter." Dan took the
tin dinner-horn, but paused before he blew.

"Go on," said Harvey. "I don't want to stay here all night."

"Question is, haow he'd take it. There was a man frum down the coast
told me once he was in a schooner where they darsen't ever blow a horn
to the dories, becaze the skipper--not the man he was with, but a
captain that had run her five years before--he'd drownded a boy
alongside in a drunk fit; an' ever after, that boy he'd row alongside
too and shout, 'Dory! dory!' with the rest."

"Dory! dory!" a muffled voice cried through the fog. They cowered
again, and the horn dropped from Dan's hand.

"Hold on!" cried Harvey; "it's the cook."

"Dunno what made me think o' thet fool tale, either," said Dan. "It's
the doctor, sure enough."

"Dan! Danny! Oooh, Dan! Harve! Harvey! Oooh, Haarveee!"

"We're here," sung both boys together. They heard oars, but could see
nothing till the cook, shining and dripping, rowed into them.

"What iss happened?" said he. "You will be beaten at home."

"Thet's what we want. Thet's what we're sufferin' for," said Dan.
"Anything homey's good enough fer us. We've had kinder depressin'
company." As the cook passed them a line, Dan told him the tale.

"Yess! He come for hiss knife," was all he said at the end.

Never had the little rocking "We're Here" looked so deliciously
home--like as when the cook, born and bred in fogs, rowed them back to
her. There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying
smell of food forward, and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the
others, all quite alive and solid, leaning over the rail and promising
them a first-class pounding. But the cook was a black master of
strategy. He did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more
striking points of the tale, explaining as he backed and bumped round
the counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck.
So the boys came overside as rather uncanny heroes, and every one asked
them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble. Little Penn
delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions; but public
opinion was against him and in favour of Long Jack, who told the most
excruciating ghost-stories to nearly midnight. Under that influence no
one except Salters and Penn said anything about "idolatry" when the
cook put a lighted candle, a cake of flour and water, and a pinch of
salt on a shingle, and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman
quiet in case he was still restless. Dan lit the candle because he had
bought the belt, and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he
could see the ducking point of flame.

Said Harvey to Dan, as they turned in after watch: "How about progress
and Catholic superstitions?"

"Huh! I guess I'm as enlightened and progressive as the next man, but
when it comes to a dead St. Malo deck-hand scarin' a couple o' pore
boys stiff fer the sake of a thirty-cent knife, why, then, the cook can
take hold fer all o' me. I mistrust furriners, livin' or dead."

Next morning all, except the cook, were rather ashamed of the
ceremonies, and went to work double tides, speaking gruffly to one
another.

The "We're Here" was racing neck and neck for her last few loads
against the "Parry Norman"; and so close was the struggle that the
Fleet took sides and betted tobacco. All hands worked at the lines or
dressing-down till they fell asleep where they stood--beginning before
dawn and ending when it was too dark to see. They even used the cook as
pitcher, and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt, while Dan helped
to dress down. Luckily a "Parry Norman" man sprained his ankle falling
down the fo'c'sle, and the "We're Heres" gained. Harvey could not see
how one more fish could be crammed into her, but Disko and Tom Platt
stowed and stowed, and planked the mass down with big stones from the
ballast, and there was always "jest another day's work." Disko did not
tell them when all the salt was wetted. He rolled to the lazarette aft
the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail. This was at ten in
the morning. The riding-sail was down and the main- and top-sail were
up by noon, and dories came alongside with letters for home, envying
their good fortune. At last she cleared decks, hoisted her flag,--as is
the right of the first boat off the Banks,--up-anchored, and began to
move. Disko pretended that he wished to accommodate folk who had not
sent in their mail, and so worked her gracefully in and out among the
schooners. In reality, that was his little triumphant procession, and
for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was. Dan's
accordion and Tom Platt's fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse
you must not sing till all the salt is wet:

  "Hih! Yih! Yoho!
  Send your letters raound!
  All our salt is wetted, an' the anchor's off the graound!
  Bend, oh, bend your mains'l!, we're back to Yankeeland--
  With fifteen hunder' quintal,
  An' fifteen hunder' quintal,
  'Teen hunder' toppin' quintal,
  'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand."

The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal, and the
Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolk and
owners, while the "We're Here" finished the musical ride through the
Fleet, her head-sails quivering like a man's hand when he raises it to
say good-bye.

Harvey very soon discovered that the "We're Here", with her
riding-sail, strolling from berth to berth, and the "We're Here" headed
west by south under home canvas, were two very different boats. There
was a bite and kick to the wheel even in "boy's" weather; he could feel
the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges,
and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy.

Disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails; and when those were
flattened like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail,
which was put over by hand every time she went about. In spare moments
they pumped, for the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve
a cargo. But since there was no fishing, Harvey had time to look at the
sea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on
most intimate terms with her surroundings. They saw little of the
horizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she was elbowing,
fidgeting, and coaxing her steadfast way through grey, grey-blue, or
black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam;
or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger
water-hill. It was as if she said: "You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm
only the little 'We're Here'." Then she would slide away chuckling
softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The
dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through
long days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull,
began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over
with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working
across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the
splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of
the morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors;
the salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over
thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of
everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under
the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and
Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.

But the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together, Tom
Platt within hail, and she cuddled her lee-rail down to the crashing
blue, and kept a little home-made rainbow arching unbroken over her
windlass. Then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts, and the
sheets creaked, and the sails filled with roaring; and when she slid
into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress,
and came out, her jib wet half-way up, yearning and peering for the
tall twin-lights of Thatcher's Island.

They left the cold grey of the Bank sea, saw the lumber-ships making
for Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence, with the Jersey salt-brigs
from Spain and Sicily; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank
that drove them within view of the East light of Sable Island,--a sight
Disko did not linger over,--and stayed with them past Western and Le
Have, to the northern fringe of George's. From there they picked up the
deeper water, and let her go merrily.

"Hattie's pulling on the string," Dan confided to Harvey. "Hattie an'
ma. Next Sunday you'll be hirin' a boy to throw water on the windows to
make ye go to sleep. 'Guess you'll keep with us till your folks come.
Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?"

"Hot bath'?" said Harvey. His eyebrows were all white with dried spray.

"That's good, but a night-shirt's better. I've been dreamin' o'
night-shirts ever since we bent our mainsail. Ye can wiggle your toes
then. Ma'll hev a new one fer me, all washed soft. It's home, Harve.
It's home! Ye can sense it in the air. We're runnin' into the aidge of
a hot wave naow, an' I can smell the bayberries. Wonder if we'll get in
fer supper. Port a trifle."

The hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep
smoothed out, blue and oily, round them. When they whistled for a wind
only the rain came in spiky rods, bubbling and drumming, and behind the
rain the thunder and the lightning of mid-August. They lay on the deck
with bare feet and arms, telling one another what they would order at
their first meal ashore; for now the land was in plain sight. A
Gloucester swordfish-boat drifted alongside, a man in the little pulpit
on the bowsprit flourishing his harpoon, his bare head plastered down
with the wet. "And all's well!" he sang cheerily, as though he were
watch on a big liner. "Wouverman's waiting fer you, Disko. What's the
news o' the Fleet?"

Disko shouted it and passed on, while the wild summer storm pounded
overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four
different quarters at once. It gave the low circle of hills round
Gloucester Harbour, Ten Pound Island, the fish-sheds, with the broken
line of house-roofs, and each spar and buoy on the water, in blinding
photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the
"We're Here" crawled in on half-flood, and the whistling-buoy moaned
and mourned behind her. Then the storm died out in long, separated,
vicious dags of blue-white flame, followed by a single roar like the
roar of a mortar-battery, and the shaken air tingled under the stars as
it got back to silence.

"The flag, the flag!" said Disko, suddenly, pointing upward.

"What is ut?" said Long Jack.

"Otto! Ha'af mast. They can see us frum shore now."

"I'd clean forgot. He's no folk to Gloucester, has he?"

"Girl he was goin' to be married to this fall."

"Mary pity her!" said Long Jack, and lowered the little flag half-mast
for the sake of Otto, swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three
months before.

Disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the "We're Here" to
Wouverman's wharf, giving his orders in whispers, while she swung round
moored tugs and night-watchmen hailed her from the ends of inky-black
piers. Over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession,
Harvey could feel the land close round him once more, with all its
thousands of people asleep, and the smell of earth after rain, and the
familiar noise of a switching-engine coughing to herself in a
freight-yard; and all those things made his heart beat and his throat
dry up as he stood by the foresheet. They heard the anchor-watch
snoring on a lighthouse-tug, nosed into a pocket of darkness where a
lantern glimmered on either side; somebody waked with a grunt, threw
them a rope, and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great
iron-roofed sheds full of warm emptiness, and lay there without a sound.

Then Harvey sat down by the wheel, and sobbed and sobbed as though his
heart would break, and a tall woman who had been sitting on a
weigh-scale dropped down into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the
cheek; for she was his mother, and she had seen the "We're Here" by the
lightning-flashes. She took no notice of Harvey till he had recovered
himself a little and Disko had told her his story. Then they went to
Disko's house together as the dawn was breaking; and until the
telegraph office was open and he could wire to his folk, Harvey Cheyne
was perhaps the loneliest boy in all America. But the curious thing was
that Disko and Dan seemed to think none the worse of him for crying.

Wouverman was not ready for Disko's prices till Disko, sure that the
"We're Here" was at least a week ahead of any other Gloucester boat,
had given him a few days to swallow them; so all hands played about the
streets, and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley, on principle, as
he said, till the conductor let him ride free. But Dan went about with
his freckled nose in the air, bungful of mystery and most haughty to
his family.

"Dan, I'll hev to lay inter you ef you act this way," said Troop,
pensively. "Sence we've come ashore this time you've bin a heap too
fresh."

"I'd lay into him naow ef he was mine," said Uncle Salters, sourly. He
and Penn boarded with the Troops.

"Oho!" said Dan, shuffling with the accordion round the back-yard,
ready to leap the fence if the enemy advanced. "Dad, you're welcome to
your own jedgment, but remember I've warned ye. Your own flesh an'
blood ha' warned ye! 'Tain't any o' my fault ef you're mistook, but
I'll be on deck to watch ye. An' ez fer yeou, Uncle Salters, Pharaoh's
chief butler ain't in it 'longside o' you! You watch aout an' wait.
You'll be ploughed under like your own blamed clover; but me--Dan
Troop--I'll flourish like a green bay-tree because I warn't stuck on my
own opinion."

Disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful
carpet-slippers. "You're gettin' ez crazy as poor Harve. You two go
araound gigglin' an' squinchin' an' kickin' each other under the table
till there's no peace in the haouse," said he.

"There's goin' to be a heap less--fer some folks," Dan replied. "You
wait an' see."

He and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester, where they
tramped through the bayberry-bushes to the lighthouse, and lay down on
the big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry. Harvey had shown
Dan a telegram, and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst.

"Harve's folk?" said Dan, with an unruffled face after supper. "Well, I
guess they don't amount to much of anything, or we'd ha' heard frum 'em
by naow. His pop keeps a kind o' store out West. Maybe he'll give you's
much as five dollars, dad."

"What did I tell ye?" said Salters. "Don't sputter over your vittles,
Dan."



CHAPTER IX

Whatever his private sorrows may be, a multimillionaire, like any other
workingman, should keep abreast of his business. Harvey Cheyne, senior,
had gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down, half mad, who
dreamed day and night of her son drowning in the grey seas. He had
surrounded her with doctors, trained nurses, massage-women, and even
faith-cure companions, but they were useless. Mrs. Cheyne lay still and
moaned, or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would
listen. Hope she had none, and who could offer it? All she needed was
assurance that drowning did not hurt; and her husband watched to guard
lest she should make the experiment. Of his own sorrow he spoke
little--hardly realised the depth of it till he caught himself asking
the calendar on his writing-desk, "What's the use of going on?"

There had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that,
some day, when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left
college, he would take his son to his heart and lead him into his
possessions. Then that boy, he argued, as busy fathers do, would
instantly become his companion, partner, and ally, and there would
follow splendid years of great works carried out together--the old head
backing the young fire. Now his boy was dead--lost at sea, as it might
have been a Swede sailor from one of Cheyne's big tea-ships; the wife
was dying, or worse; he himself was trodden down by platoons of women
and doctors and maids and attendants; worried almost beyond endurance
by the shift and change of her poor restless whims; hopeless, with no
heart to meet his many enemies.

He had taken the wife to his raw new palace in San Diego, where she and
her people occupied a wing of great price, and Cheyne, in a
verandah-room, between a secretary and a typewriter, who was also a
telegraphist, toiled along wearily from day to day. There was a war of
rates among four Western railroads in which he was supposed to be
interested; a devastating strike had developed in his lumber-camps in
Oregon, and the legislature of the State of California, which has no
love for its makers, was preparing open war against him.

Ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered, and have
waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign. But now he sat limply, his
soft black hat pushed forward on to his nose, his big body shrunk
inside his loose clothes, staring at his boots or the Chinese junks in
the bay, and assenting absently to the secretary's questions as he
opened the Saturday mail.

Cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull
out. He carried huge insurances, could buy himself royal annuities, and
between one of his places in Colorado and a little society (that would
do the wife good), say in Washington and the South Carolina islands, a
man might forget plans that had come to nothing. On the other hand...

The click of the typewriter stopped; the girl was looking at the
secretary, who had turned white.

He passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco:

Picked up by fishing schooner "We're Here" having fallen off boat great
times on Banks fishing all well waiting Gloucester Mass care Disko
Troop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is mama Harvey N.
Cheyne.

The father let it fall, laid his head down on the roller-top of the
shut desk, and breathed heavily. The secretary ran for Mrs. Cheyne's
doctor, who found Cheyne pacing to and fro.

"What-what d'you think of it? Is it possible? Is there any meaning to
it? I can't quite make it out," he cried.

"I can," said the doctor. "I lose seven thousand a year--that's all."
He thought of the struggling New York practice he had dropped at
Cheyne's imperious bidding, and returned the telegram with a sigh.

"You mean you'd tell her? 'Maybe a fraud?"

"What's the motive?" said the doctor, coolly. "Detection's too certain.
It's the boy sure enough."

Enter a French maid, impudently, as an indispensable one who is kept on
only by large wages.

"Mrs. Cheyne she say you must come at once. She think you are seek."

The master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed
Suzanne; and a thin, high voice on the upper landing of the great
white-wood square staircase cried: "What is it? what has happened?"

No doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house
a moment later, when her husband blurted out the news.

"And that's all right," said the doctor, serenely, to the typewriter.
"About the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is
that joy don't kill, Miss Kinzey."

"I know it; but we've a heap to do first." Miss Kinzey was from
Milwaukee, somewhat direct of speech; and as her fancy leaned towards
the secretary, she divined there was work in hand. He was looking
earnestly at the vast roller-map of America on the wall.

"Milsom, we're going right across. Private car straight
through--Boston. Fix the connections," shouted Cheyne down the
staircase.

"I thought so."

The secretary turned to the typewriter, and their eyes met (out of that
was born a story--nothing to do with this story). She looked
inquiringly, doubtful of his resources. He signed to her to move to the
Morse as a general brings brigades into action. Then he swept his hand.
musician-wise through his hair, regarded the ceiling, and set to work,
while Miss Kinzey's white fingers called up the Continent of America.

"K. H. Wade, Los Angeles--The 'Constance' is at Los Angeles, isn't she,
Miss Kinzey?"

"Yep." Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his
watch.

"Ready? Send 'Constance,' private car, here, and arrange for special to
leave here Sunday in time to connect with New York Limited at Sixteenth
Street, Chicago, Tuesday next."

Click--click--click! "Couldn't you better that'?"

"Not on those grades. That gives 'em sixty hours from here to Chicago.
They won't gain anything by taking a special east of that. Ready? Also
arrange with Lake Shore and Michigan Southern to take 'Constance' on
New York Central and Hudson River Buffalo to Albany, and B. and A. the
same Albany to Boston. Indispensable I should reach Boston Wednesday
evening. Be sure nothing prevents. Have also wired Canniff, Toucey, and
Barnes.--Sign, Cheyne."

Miss Kinzey nodded, and the secretary went on.

"Now then. Canniff, Toucey, and Barnes, of course. Ready? Canniff
Chicago. Please take my private car 'Constance 'from Santa Fe at
Sixteenth Street next Tuesday p. m. on N. Y. Limited through to Buffalo
and deliver N. Y. C. for Albany.--Ever bin to N' York, Miss Kinzey?
We'll go some day. Ready? Take car Buffalo to Albany on Limited Tuesday
p. m. That's for Toucey."

"Haven't bin to Noo York, but I know that!" with a toss of the head.

"Beg pardon. Now, Boston and Albany, Barnes, same instructions from
Albany through to Boston. Leave three-five P. M. (you needn't wire
that); arrive nine-five P. M. Wednesday. That covers everything Wade
will do, but it pays to shake up the managers."

"It's great," said Miss Kinzey, with a look of admiration. This was the
kind of man she understood and appreciated.

"'Tisn't bad," said Milsom, modestly. "Now, any one but me would have
lost thirty hours and spent a week working out the run, instead of
handing him over to the Santa Fe straight through to Chicago."

"But see here, about that Noo York Limited. Chauncey Depew himself
couldn't hitch his car to her," Miss Kinzey suggested, recovering
herself.

"Yes, but this isn't Chauncey. It's Cheyne--lightning. It goes."

"Even so. Guess we'd better wire the boy. You've forgotten that,
anyhow."

"I'll ask."

When he returned with the father's message bidding Harvey meet them in
Boston at an appointed hour, he found Miss Kinzey laughing over the
keys. Then Milsom laughed too, for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles
ran: "We want to know why--why--why? General uneasiness developed and
spreading."

Ten minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words: "If
crime of century is maturing please warn friends in time. We are all
getting to cover here."

This was capped by a message from Topeka (and wherein Topeka was
concerned even Milsom could not guess): "Don't shoot, Colonel. We'll
come down."

Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the
telegrams were laid before him. "They think we're on the war-path. Tell
'em we don't feel like fighting just now, Milsom. Tell 'em what we're
going for. I guess you and Miss Kinzey had better come along, though it
isn't likely I shall do any business on the road. Tell 'em the
truth--for once."

So the truth was told. Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the
secretary added the memorable quotation, "Let us have peace," and in
board-rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty-three
million dollars' worth of variously manipulated railroad interests
breathed more freely. Cheyne was flying to meet the only son, so
miraculously restored to him. The bear was seeking his cub, not the
bulls. Hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial
lives put away the weapons and wished him God-speed, while half a dozen
panic-smitten tin-pot roads perked up their heads and spoke of the
wonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried the hatchet.

It was a busy week-end among the wires; for, now that their anxiety was
removed, men and cities hastened to accommodate. Los Angeles called to
San Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know
and be ready in their lonely round-houses; Barstow passed the word to
the Atlantic and Pacific; the Albuquerque flung it the whole length of
the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe management, even into Chicago. An
engine, combination-car with crew, and the great and gilded "Constance"
private car were to be "expedited" over those two thousand three
hundred and fifty miles. The train would take precedence of one hundred
and seventy-seven others meeting and passing; despatches and crews of
every one of those said trains must be notified. Sixteen locomotives,
sixteen engineers, and sixteen firemen would be needed--each and every
one the best available. Two and one half minutes would be allowed for
changing engines, three for watering, and two for coaling. "Warn the
men, and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly; for Harvey Cheyne is in
a hurry, a hurry-a hurry," sang the wires. "Forty miles an hour will be
expected, and division superintendents will accompany this special over
their respective divisions. From San Diego to Sixteenth Street,
Chicago, let the magic carpet be laid down. Hurry! oh, hurry!"

"It will be hot," said Cheyne, as they rolled out of San Diego in the
dawn of Sunday. "We're going to hurry, mama, just as fast as ever we
can; but I really don't think there's any good of your putting on your
bonnet and gloves yet. You'd much better lie down and take your
medicine. I'd play you a game o' dominoes, but it's Sunday."

"I'll be good. Oh, I will be good. Only--taking off my bonnet makes me
feel as if we'd never get there."

"Try to sleep a little, mama, and we'll be in Chicago before you know."

"But it's Boston, father. Tell them to hurry."

The six-foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the
Mohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. That would come later.
The heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned
east to the Needles and the Colorado River. The car cracked in the
utter drought and glare, and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne's
neck, and toiled up the long, long grades, past Ash Fork, towards
Flagstaff, where the forests and quarries are, under the dry, remote
skies. The needle of the speed-indicator flicked and wagged to and fro;
the cinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl of dust sucked after the
whirling wheels, The crew of the combination sat on their bunks,
panting in their shirt-sleeves, and Cheyne found himself among them
shouting old, old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows,
above the roar of the car. He told them about his son, and how the sea
had given up its dead, and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him;
asked after "her, back there," and whether she could stand it if the
engineer "let her out a piece," and Cheyne thought she could.
Accordingly, the great fire-horse was "let out" from Flagstaff to
Winslow, till a division superintendent protested.

But Mrs. Cheyne, in the boudoir state-room, where the French maid,
sallow-white with fear, clung to the silver door-handle, only moaned a
little and begged her husband to bid them "hurry." And so they dropped
the dry sands and moon-struck rocks of Arizona behind them, and grilled
on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brake-hose
told them they were at Coolidge by the Continental Divide. Three bold
and experienced men--cool, confident, and dry when they began; white,
quivering, and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible
wheels--swung her over the great lift from Albuquerque to Glorietta and
beyond Springer, up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the State line,
whence they dropped rocking into La Junta, had sight of the Arkansaw,
and tore down the long slope to Dodge City, where Cheyne took comfort
once again from setting his watch an hour ahead.

There was very little talk in the car. The secretary and typewriter sat
together on the stamped Spanish-leather cushions by the plate-glass
observation-window at the rear end, watching the surge and ripple of
the ties crowded back behind them, and, it is believed, making notes of
the scenery. Cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant
gorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination, an unlit cigar
in his teeth, till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal
enemy, and did their best to entertain him.

At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all
the luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the
emptiness of abject desolation. Now they heard the swish of a
water-tank, and the guttural voice of a China-man, the clink-clink of
hammers that tested the Krupp steel wheels, and the oath of a tramp
chased off the rear platform; now the solid crash of coal shot into the
tender; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a waiting
train. Now they looked out into great abysses, a trestle purring
beneath their tread, or up to rocks that barred out half the stars. Now
scaur and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the
horizon's edge, and now broke into hills lower and lower, till at last
came the true plains.

At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper
containing some sort of an interview with Harvey, who had evidently
fallen in with an enterprising reporter, telegraphed on from Boston.
The joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy,
and it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for a while. Her one word "hurry" was
conveyed by the crews to the engineers at Nickerson, Topeka, and
Marceline, where the grades are easy, and they brushed the Continent
behind them. Towns and villages were close together now, and a man
could feel here that he moved among people.

"I can't see the dial, and my eyes ache so. What are we doing?"

"The very best we can, mama. There's no sense in getting in before the
Limited. We'd only have to wait."

"I don't care. I want to feel we're moving. Sit down and tell me the
miles."

Cheyne sat down and read the dial for her (there were some miles which
stand for records to this day), but the seventy-foot car never changed
its long, steamer-like roll, moving through the heat with the hum of a
giant bee. Yet the speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne; and the heat,
the remorseless August heat, was making her giddy; the clock-hands
would not move, and when, oh, when would they be in Chicago?

It is not true that, as they changed engines at Fort Madison, Cheyne
passed over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an
endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on
equal terms for evermore. He paid his obligations to engineers and
firemen as he believed they deserved, and only his bank knows what he
gave the crews who had sympathised with him. It is on record that the
last crew took entire charge of switching operations at Sixteenth
Street, because "she" was in a doze at last, and Heaven was to help any
one who bumped her.

Now the highly paid specialist who conveys the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Limited from Chicago to Elkhart is something of an autocrat,
and he does not approve of being told how to back up to a car. None the
less he handled the "Constance" as if she might have been a load of
dynamite, and when the crew rebuked him, they did it in whispers and
dumb show.

"Pshaw!" said the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe men, discussing life
later, "we weren't runnin' for a record. Harvey Cheyne's wife, she were
sick back, an' we didn't want to jounce her. 'Come to think of it, our
runnin' time from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54. You can tell that to
them Eastern way-trains. When we're tryin' for a record, we'll let you
know."

To the Western man (though this would not please either city) Chicago
and Boston are cheek by jowl, and some railroads encourage the
delusion. The Limited whirled the "Constance" into Buffalo and the arms
of the New York Central and Hudson River (illustrious magnates with
white whiskers and gold charms on their watch-chains boarded her here
to talk a little business to Cheyne), who slid her gracefully into
Albany, where the Boston and Albany completed the run from tide-water
to tide-water--total time, eighty-seven hours and thirty-five minutes,
or three days, fifteen hours and one half. Harvey was waiting for them.

After violent emotion most people and all boys demand food. They
feasted the returned prodigal behind drawn curtains, cut off in their
great happiness, while the trains roared in and out around them. Harvey
ate, drank, and enlarged on his adventures all in one breath, and when
he had a hand free his mother fondled it. His voice was thickened with
living in the open, salt air; his palms were rough and hard, his wrists
dotted with the marks of gurry-sores; and a fine full flavour of
cod-fish hung round rubber boots and blue jersey.

The father, well used to judging men, looked at him keenly. He did not
know what enduring harm the boy might have taken. Indeed, he caught
himself thinking that he knew very little whatever of his son; but he
distinctly remembered an unsatisfied, dough-faced youth who took
delight in "calling down the old man" and reducing his mother to
tears--such a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel
piazzas, where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or revile
the bell-boys. But this well set-up fisher-youth did not wriggle,
looked at him with eyes steady, clear, and unflinching, and spoke in a
tone distinctly, even startlingly, respectful. There was that in his
voice, too, which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent,
and that the new Harvey had come to stay.

"Some one's been coercing him," thought Cheyne. "Now Constance would
never have allowed that. Don't see as Europe could have done it any
better."

"But why didn't you tell this man, Troop, who you were?" the mother
repeated, when Harvey had expanded his story at least twice.

"Disko Troop, dear. The best man that ever walked a deck. I don't care
who the next is."

"Why didn't you tell him to put you ashore? You know papa would have
made it up to him ten times over."

"I know it; but he thought I was crazy. I'm afraid I called him a thief
because I couldn't find the bills in my pocket."

"A sailor found them by the flagstaff that--that night," sobbed Mrs.
Cheyne.

"That explains it, then. I don't blame Troop any. I just said I
wouldn't work--on a Banker, too--and of course he hit me on the nose,
and oh! I bled like a stuck hog."

"My poor darling! They must have abused you horribly."

"Dunno quite. Well, after that, I saw a light."

Cheyne slapped his leg and chuckled. This was going to be a boy after
his own hungry heart. He had never seen precisely that twinkle in
Harvey's eye before.

"And the old man gave me ten and a half a month; he's paid me half now;
and I took hold with Dan and pitched right in. I can't do a man's work
yet. But I can handle a dory 'most as well as Dan, and I don't get
rattled in a fog--much; and I can take my trick in light winds--that's
steering, dear--and I can 'most bait up a trawl, and I know my ropes,
of course; and I can pitch fish till the cows come home, and I'm great
on old Josephus, and I'll show you how I can clear coffee with a piece
of fish-skin, and--I think I'll have another cup, please. Say, you've
no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month!"

"I began with eight and a half, my son," said Cheyne.

"'That so? You never told me, sir."

"You never asked, Harve. I'll tell you about it some day, if you care
to listen. Try a stuffed olive."

"Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how
the next man gets his vittles. It's great to have a trimmed-up meal
again. We were well fed, though. Best mug on the Banks. Disko fed us
first-class. He's a great man. And Dan--that's his son--Dan's my
partner. And there's Uncle Salters and his manures, an' he reads
Josephus. He's sure I'm crazy yet. And there's poor little Penn, and he
is crazy. You mustn't talk to him about Johnstown, because--And, oh,
you must know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel. Manuel saved my life.
I'm sorry he's a Portugee. He can't talk much, but he's an everlasting
musician. He found me struck adrift and drifting, and hauled me in."

"I wonder your nervous system isn't completely wrecked," said Mrs.
Cheyne.

"What for, mama? I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept
like a dead man."

That was too much for Mrs. Cheyne, who began to think of her visions of
a corpse rocking on the salty seas. She went to her state-room, and
Harvey curled up beside his father, explaining his indebtedness.

"You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd, Harve.
They seem to be good men on your showing."

"Best in the Fleet, sir. Ask at Gloucester," said Harvey. "But Disko
believes still he's cured me of being crazy. Dan's the only one I've
let on to about you, and our private cars and all the rest of it, and
I'm not quite sure Dan believes. I want to paralyse 'em to-morrow. Say,
can't they run the 'Constance' over to Gloucester? Mama don't look fit
to be moved, anyway, and we're bound to finish cleaning out by
to-morrow. Wouverman takes our fish. You see, we're first off the Banks
this season, and it's four twenty-five a quintal. We held out till he
paid it. They want it quick."

"You mean you'll have to work to-morrow, then?"

"I told Troop I would. I'm on the scales. I've brought the tallies with
me." He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that
made his father choke. "There isn't but three--no--two ninety-four or
five quintal more by my reckoning."

"Hire a substitute," suggested Cheyne, to see what Harvey would say.

"Can't, sir. I'm tally-man for the schooner. Troop says I've a better
head for figures than Dan. Troop's a mighty just man."

"Well, suppose I don't move the 'Constance' to-night, how'll you fix
it?"

Harvey looked at the clock, which marked twenty past eleven.

"Then I'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight.
They let us men from the Fleet ride free, as a rule."

"That's a notion. But I think we can get the 'Constance' around about
as soon as your men's freight. Better go to bed now."

Harvey spread himself on the sofa, kicked off his boots, and was asleep
before his father could shade the electrics. Cheyne sat watching the
young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead, and
among many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might
perhaps have been neglectful as a father.

"One never knows when one's taking one's biggest risks," he said. "It
might have been worse than drowning; but I don't think it has--I don't
think it has. If it hasn't, I haven't enough to pay Troop, that's all;
and I don't think it has."

Morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows, the "Constance"
was side-tracked among freight-cars at Gloucester, and Harvey had gone
to his business.

"Then he'll fall overboard again and be drowned," the mother said
bitterly.

"We'll go and look, ready to throw him a rope in case. You've never
seen him working for his bread," said the father.

"What nonsense! As if any one expected--"

"Well, the man that hired him did. He's about right, too."

They went down between the stores full of fishermen's oilskins to
Wouverman's wharf, where the "We're Here" rode high, her Bank flag
still flying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light.
Disko stood by the main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle
Salters at the tackle. Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as
Long Jack and Tom Platt filled them, and Harvey, with a notebook,
represented the skipper's interests before the clerk of the scales on
the salt-sprinkled wharf-edge.

"Ready!" cried the voices below. "Haul!" cried Disko. "Hi!" said
Manuel. "Here!" said Dan, swinging the basket. Then they heard Harvey's
voice, clear and fresh, checking the weights.

The last of the fish had been whipped out, and Harvey leaped from the
string-piece six feet to a ratline, as the shortest way to hand Disko
the tally, shouting, "Two ninety-seven, and an empty hold!"

"What's total, Harve?" said Disko.

"Eight sixty-five. Three thousand six hundred and seventy-six dollars
and a quarter. 'Wish I'd share as well as wage."

"Well, I won't go so far as to say you hevn't deserved it, Harve. Don't
you want to slip up to Wouverman's office and take him our tallies?"

"Who's that boy?" said Cheyne to Dan, well used to all manner of
questions from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders.

"Well, he's a kind o' supercargo," was the answer. "We picked him up
struck adrift on the Banks. Fell overboard from a liner, he sez. He was
a passenger. He's by way o' bein' a fisherman now."

"Is he worth his keep?"

"Ye-ep. Dad, this man wants to know ef Harve's worth his keep. Say,
would you like to go aboard? We'll fix a ladder for her."

"I should very much, indeed. 'Twon't hurt you, mama, and you'll be able
to see for yourself."

The woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the
ladder, and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft.

"Be you anyways interested in Harve?" said Disko.

"Well, ye-es."

"He's a good boy, an' ketches right hold jest as he's bid. You've heard
haow we found him? He was sufferin' from nervous prostration, I guess,
'r else his head had hit somethin', when we hauled him aboard. He's all
over that naow. Yes, this is the cabin. 'Tain't anyways in order, but
you're quite welcome to look around. Those are his figures on the
stove-pipe, where we keep the reckonin' mostly."

"Did he sleep here?" said Mrs. Cheyne, sitting on a yellow locker and
surveying the disorderly bunks.

"No. He berthed forward, madam, an' only fer him an' my boy hookin'
fried pies an' muggin' up when they ought to ha' been asleep, I dunno
as I've any special fault to find with him."

"There weren't nothin' wrong with Harve," said Uncle Salters,
descending the steps. "He hung my boots on the main-truck, and he ain't
over an' above respectful to such as knows more'n he do, especially
about farmin'; but he were mostly misled by Dan."

Dan, in the meantime, profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that
morning, was executing a war-dance on deck. "Tom, Tom!" he whispered
down the hatch. "His folks has come, an' dad hain't caught on yet, an'
they're pow-wowin' in the cabin. She's a daisy, an' he's all Harve
claimed he was, by the looks of him."

"Howly Smoke!" said Long Jack, climbing out covered with salt and
fish-skin. "D'ye belave his tale av the kid an' the little four-horse
rig was thrue?"

"I knew it all along," said Dan. "Come an' see dad mistook in his
judgments."

They came delightedly, just in time to hear Cheyne say: "I'm glad he
has a good character, because--he's my son."

Disko's jaw fell,--Long Jack always vowed that he heard the click of
it,--and he stared alternately at the man and the woman.

"I got his telegram in San Diego four days ago, and we came over."

"In a private car?" said Dan. "He said ye might."

"In a private car, of course."

Dan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks.

"There was a tale he tould us av drivin' four little ponies in a rig av
his own," said Long Jack. "Was that thrue now?"

"Very likely," said Cheyne. "Was it, mama?"

"He had a little drag when we were in Toledo, I think," said the mother.

Long Jack whistled. "Oh, Disko!" said he, and that was all.

"I wuz--I am mistook in my jedgments--worse'n the men o' Marblehead,"
said Disko, as though the words were being windlassed out of him. "I
don't mind ownin' to you, Mister Cheyne, as I mistrusted the boy to be
crazy. He talked kinder odd about money."

"So he told me."

"Did he tell ye anything else? 'Cause I pounded him once." This with a
somewhat anxious glance at Mrs. Cheyne.

"Oh, yes," Cheyne replied. "I should say it probably did him more good
than anything else in the world."

"I jedged 'twuz necessary, er I wouldn't ha' done it. I don't want you
to think we abuse our boys any on this packet."

"I don't think you do, Mr. Troop."

Mrs. Cheyne had been looking at the faces--Disko's ivory-yellow,
hairless, iron countenance; Uncle Salters's, with its rim of
agricultural hair; Penn's bewildered simplicity; Manuel's quiet smile;
Long Jack's grin of delight; and Tom Platt's scar. Rough, by her
standards, they certainly were; but she had a mother's wits in her
eyes, and she rose with outstretched hands.

"Oh, tell me, which is who?" said she, half sobbing. "I want to thank
you and bless you--all of you."

"Faith, that pays me a hunder time," said Long Jack.

Disko introduced them all in due form. The captain of an old-time
Chinaman could have done no better, and Mrs. Cheyne babbled
incoherently. She nearly threw herself into Manuel's arms when she
understood that he had first found Harvey.

"But how shall I leave him dreeft?" said poor Manuel. "What do you
yourself if you find him so? Eh, wha-at'? We are in one good boy, and I
am ever so pleased he come to be your son."

"And he told me Dan was his partner!" she cried. Dan was already
sufficiently pink, but he turned a rich crimson when Mrs. Cheyne kissed
him on both cheeks before the assembly. Then they led her forward to
show her the fo'c'sle, at which she wept again, and must needs go down
to see Harvey's identical bunk, and there she found the nigger cook
cleaning up the stove, and he nodded as though she were some one he had
expected to meet for years. They tried, two at a time, to explain the
boat's daily life to her, and she sat by the pawl-post, her gloved
hands on the greasy table, laughing with trembling lips and crying with
dancing eyes.

"And who's ever to use the "We're Here" after this?" said Long Jack to
Tom Platt. "I feel it as if she'd made a cathedral av ut all."

"Cathedral!" sneered Tom Platt. "Oh, ef it had bin even the Fish
C'mmission boat instid o' this bally-hoo o' blazes. Ef we only hed some
decency an' order an' side-boys when she goes over! She'll have to
climb that ladder like a hen, an' we--we ought to be mannin' the yards!"

"Then Harvey was not mad," said Penn, slowly, to Cheyne.

"No, indeed--thank God," the big millionaire replied, stooping down
tenderly.

"It must be terrible to be mad. Except to lose your child, I do not
know anything more terrible. But your child has come back? Let us thank
God for that."

"Hello!" said Harvey, looking down upon them benignly from the wharf.

"I wuz mistook, Harve. I wuz mistook," said Disko, swiftly, holding up
a hand. "I wuz mistook in my jedgments. Ye needn't rub it in any more."

"'Guess I'll take care o' that," said Dan, under his breath.

"You'll be goin' off naow, won't ye?"

"Well, not without the balance of my wages, 'less you want to have the
"We're Here" attached."

"Thet's so; I'd clean forgot"; and he counted out the remaining
dollars. "You done all you contracted to do, Harve; and you done it
'baout's well as ef you'd been brought up--" Here Disko brought himself
up. He did not quite see where the sentence was going to end.

"Outside of a private car?" suggested Dan, wickedly.

"Come on, and I'll show her to you," said Harvey.

Cheyne stayed to talk to Disko, but the others made a procession to the
depot, with Mrs. Cheyne at the head. The French maid shrieked at the
invasion; and Harvey laid the glories of the "Constance" before them
without a word. They took them in in equal silence--stamped leather,
silver door-handles and rails, cut velvet, plate-glass, nickel, bronze,
hammered iron, and the rare woods of the Continent inlaid.

"I told you," said Harvey; "I told you." This was his crowning revenge,
and a most ample one.

Mrs. Cheyne decreed a meal; and that nothing might be lacking to the
tale Long Jack told afterwards in his boarding-house, she waited on
them herself. Men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling
gales have curiously neat and finished table-manners; but Mrs. Cheyne,
who did not know this, was surprised. She longed to have Manuel for a
butler; so silently and easily did he comport himself among the frail
glassware and dainty silver. Tom Platt remembered great days on the
Ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers;
and Long Jack, being Irish, supplied the small talk till all were at
their ease.

In the "We're Here's" cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind
their cigars. Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom
he could not offer money; equally well he knew that no money could pay
for what Disko had done. He kept his own counsel and waited for an
opening.

"I hevn't done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep' make him
work a piece an' learn him how to handle the hog-yoke," said Disko. "He
has twice my boy's head for figgers."

"By the way," Cheyne answered casually, "what d'you calculate to make
of your boy?"

Disko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin.
"Dan's jest plain boy, an' he don't allow me to do any of his thinkin'.
He'll hev this able little packet when I'm laid by. He ain't noways
anxious to quit the business. I know that."

"Mmm! 'Ever been West, Mr. Troop?"

"Bin's fer ez Noo York once in a boat. I've no use for railroads. No
more hez Dan. Salt water's good enough fer the Troops. I've been 'most
everywhere--in the nat'ral way, o' course."

"I can give him all the salt water he's likely to need--till he's a
skipper."

"Haow's that? I thought you wuz a kinder railroad king. Harve told me
so when--I was mistook in my jedgments."

"We're all apt to be mistaken. I fancied perhaps you might know I own a
line of tea-clippers--San Francisco to Yokohama--six of
'em--iron-built, about seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece."

"Blame that boy! He never told. I'd ha' listened to that, instid o' his
truck abaout railroads an' pony-carriages."

"He didn't know."

"'Little thing like that slipped his mind, I guess."

"No, I only capt--took hold of the 'Blue M.' freighters--Morgan and
McQuade's old line--this summer."

Disko collapsed where he sat, beside the stove.

"Great Caesar Almighty! I mistrust I've bin fooled from one end to the
other. Why, Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year
back--no, seven--an' he's mate on the San José now--twenty-six days was
her time out. His sister she's livin' here yet, an' she reads his
letters to my woman. An' you own the 'Blue M.' freighters?"

Cheyne nodded.

"If I'd known that I'd ha' jerked the "We're Here" back to port all
standin', on the word."

"Perhaps that wouldn't have been so good for Harvey."

"Ef I'd only known! Ef he'd only said about the cussed Line, I'd ha'
understood! I'll never stand on my own jedgments again--never. They're
well-found packets, Phil Airheart he says so."

"I'm glad to have a recommend from that quarter. Airheart's skipper of
the San José now. What I was getting at is to know whether you'd lend
me Dan for a year or two, and we'll see if we can't make a mate of him.
Would you trust him to Airheart?"

"It's a resk taking a raw boy--"

"I know a man who did more for me."

"That's diff'runt. Look at here naow, I ain't recommendin' Dan special
because he's my own flesh an' blood. I know Bank ways ain't clipper
ways, but he hain't much to learn. Steer he can--no boy better, ef I
say it--an' the rest's in our blood an' get; but I could wish he warn't
so cussed weak on navigation."

"Airheart will attend to that. He'll ship as a boy for a voyage or two,
and then we can put him in the way of doing better. Suppose you take
him in hand this winter, and I'll send for him early in the spring. I
know the Pacific's a long ways off--"

"Pshaw! We Troops, livin' an' dead, are all around the earth an' the
seas thereof."

"But I want you to understand--and I mean this--any time you think
you'd like to see him, tell me, and I'll attend to the transportation.
'Twon't cost you a cent."

"Ef you'll walk a piece with me, we'll go to my house an' talk this to
my woman. I've bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments, it don't seem
to me this was like to be real."

They went over to Troop's eighteen-hundred-dollar, blue-trimmed white
house, with a retired dory full of nasturtiums in the front yard and a
shuttered parlor which was a museum of oversea plunder. There sat a
large woman, silent and grave, with the dim eyes of those who look long
to sea for the return of their beloved. Cheyne addressed himself to
her, and she gave consent wearily.

"We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only, Mr. Cheyne," she
said--"one hundred boys an' men; and I've come so's to hate the sea as
if 'twuz alive an' listenin'. God never made it fer humans to anchor
on. These packets o' yours they go straight out, I take it, and
straight home again?"

"As straight as the winds let 'em, and I give a bonus for record
passages. Tea don't improve by being at sea."

"When he wuz little he used to play at keeping store, an' I had hopes
he might follow that up. But soon's he could paddle a dory I knew that
were goin' to be denied me."

"They're square-riggers, mother; iron-built an' well found. Remember
what Phil's sister reads you when she gits his letters."

"I've never known as Phil told lies, but he's too venturesome (like
most of 'em that use the sea). Ef Dan sees fit, Mr. Cheyne, he can
go--fer all o' me."

"She jest despises the ocean," Disko explained, "an' I--I dunno haow to
act polite, I guess, er I'd thank you better."

"My father--my own eldest brother--two nephews--an' my second sister's
man," she said, dropping her head on her hand. "Would you care fer any
one that took all those?"

Cheyne was relieved when Dan turned up and accepted with more delight
than he was able to put into words. Indeed, the offer meant a plain and
sure road to all desirable things; but Dan thought most of commanding
watch on broad decks, and looking into far-away harbours.

Mrs. Cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable Manuel in the
matter of Harvey's rescue. He seemed to have no desire for money.
Pressed hard, he said that he would take five dollars, because he
wanted to buy something for a girl. Otherwise--"How shall I take money
when I make so easy my eats and smokes? You will giva some if I like or
no? Eh, wha-at? Then you shall giva me money, but not that way. You
shall giva all you can think." He introduced her to a snuffy Portuguese
priest with a list of semi-destitute widows as long as his cassock. As
a strict Unitarian, Mrs. Cheyne could not sympathise with the creed,
but she ended by respecting the brown, voluble little man.

Manuel, faithful son of the Church, appropriated all the blessings
showered on her for her charity. "That letta me out," said he. "I have
now ver' good absolutions for six months"; and he strolled forth to get
a handkerchief for the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all
the others.

Salters went West for a season with Penn, and left no address behind.
He had a dread that these millionary people, with wasteful private
cars, might take undue interest in his companion. It was better to
visit inland relatives till the coast was clear. "Never you be adopted
by rich folk, Penn," he said in the cars, "or I'll take 'n' break this
checker-board over your head. Ef you forgit your name agin--which is
Pratt--you remember you belong with Salters Troop, an' set down right
where you are till I come fer you. Don't go taggin' araound after them
whose eyes bung out with fatness, accordin' to Scripcher."



CHAPTER X

But it was otherwise with the "We're Here's" silent cook, for he came
up, his kit in a handkerchief, and boarded the "Constance." Pay was no
particular object, and he did not in the least care where he slept. His
business, as revealed to him in dreams, was to follow Harvey for the
rest of his days. They tried argument and, at last, persuasion; but
there is a difference between one Cape Breton and two Alabama negroes,
and the matter was referred to Cheyne by the cook and porter. The
millionaire only laughed. He presumed Harvey might need a body-servant
some day or other, and was sure that one volunteer was worth five
hirelings. Let the man stay, therefore; even though he called himself
MacDonald and swore in Gaelic. The car could go back to Boston, where,
if he were still of the same mind, they would take him West.

With the "Constance," which in his heart of hearts he loathed, departed
the last remnant of Cheyne's millionairedom, and he gave himself up to
an energetic idleness. This Gloucester was a new town in a new land,
and he purposed to "take it in," as of old he had taken in all the
cities from Snohomish to San Diego of that world whence he hailed. They
made money along the crooked street which was half wharf and half
ship's store: as a leading professional he wished to learn how the
noble game was played. Men said that four out of every five fish-balls
served at New England's Sunday breakfast came from Gloucester, and
overwhelmed him with figures in proof--statistics of boats, gear,
wharf-frontage, capital invested, salting, packing, factories,
insurance, wages, repairs, and profits. He talked with the owners of
the large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men, and
whose crews were almost all Swedes or Portuguese. Then he conferred
with Disko, one of the few who owned their craft, and compared notes in
his vast head. He coiled himself away on chain-cables in marine
junk-shops, asking questions with cheerful, unslaked Western curiosity,
till all the water-front wanted to know "what in thunder that man was
after, anyhow." He prowled into the Mutual Insurance rooms, and
demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the
blackboard day by day; and that brought down upon him secretaries of
every Fisherman's Widow and Orphan Aid Society within the city limits.
They begged shamelessly, each man anxious to beat the other
institution's record, and Cheyne tugged at his beard and handed them
all over to Mrs. Cheyne.

She was resting in a boarding-house near Eastern Point--a strange
establishment, managed, apparently, by the boarders, where the
table-cloths were red-and-white-checkered, and the population, who
seemed to have known one another intimately for years, rose up at
midnight to make Welsh rare-bits if it felt hungry. On the second
morning of her stay Mrs. Cheyne put away her diamond solitaires before
she came down to breakfast.

"They're most delightful people," she confided to her husband; "so
friendly and simple, too, though they are all Boston, nearly."

"That isn't simpleness, mama," he said, looking across the boulders
behind the apple-trees where the hammocks were slung. "It's the other
thing, that we--that I haven't got."

"It can't be," said Mrs. Cheyne, quietly. "There isn't a woman here
owns a dress that cost a hundred dollars. Why, we--"

"I know it, dear. We have--of course we have. I guess it's only the
style they wear East. Are you having a good time?"

"I don't see very much of Harvey; he's always with you; but I ain't
near as nervous as I was."

"I haven't had such a good time since Willie died. I never rightly
understood that I had a son before this. Harve's got to be a great boy.
'Anything I can fetch you, dear? 'Cushion under your head? Well, we'll
go down to the wharf again and look around."

Harvey was his father's shadow in those days, and the two strolled
along side by side, Cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his
hand on the boy's square shoulder. It was then that Harvey noticed and
admired what had never struck him before--his father's curious power of
getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street.

"How d'you make 'em tell you everything without opening your head?"
demanded the son, as they came out of a rigger's loft.

"I've dealt with quite a few men in my time, Harve, and one sizes 'em
up somehow, I guess. I know something about myself, too." Then, after a
pause, as they sat down on a wharf-edge: "Men can 'most always tell
when a man has handled things for himself, and then they treat him as
one of themselves."

"Same as they treat me down at Wouverman's wharf. I'm one of the crowd
now. Disko has told every one I've earned my pay." Harvey spread out
his hands and rubbed the palms together. "They're all soft again," he
said dolefully.

"Keep 'em that way for the next few years, while you're getting your
education. You can harden 'em up after."

"Ye-es, I suppose so," was the reply, in no delighted voice.

"It rests with you, Harve. You can take cover behind your mama, of
course, and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your
highstrungness and all that kind of poppycock."


"Have I ever done that?" said Harvey, uneasily.

His father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand. "You know as
well as I do that I can't make anything of you if you don't act
straight by me. I can handle you alone if you'll stay alone, but I
don't pretend to manage both you and mama. Life's too short, anyway."

"Don't make me out much of a fellow, does it?"

"I guess it was my fault a good deal; but if you want the truth, you
haven't been much of anything up to date. Now, have you?"

"Umm! Disko thinks . . . Say, what d'you reckon it's cost you to raise
me from the start--first, last, and all over?"

Cheyne smiled. "I've never kept track, but I should estimate, in
dollars and cents, nearer fifty than forty thousand; maybe sixty. The
young generation comes high. It has to have things, and it tires of
'em, and--the old man foots the bill."

Harvey whistled, but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his
upbringing had cost so much. "And all that's sunk capital, isn't it?"

"Invested, Harve. Invested, I hope."

"Making it only thirty thousand, the thirty I've earned is about ten
cents on the hundred. That's a mighty poor catch." Harvey wagged his
head solemnly.

Cheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water.

"Disko has got a heap more than that out of Dan since he was ten; and
Dan's at school half the year, too."

"Oh, that's what you're after, is it?"

"No. I'm not after anything. I'm not stuck on myself any just
now--that's all . . . . I ought to be kicked."

"I can't do it, old man; or I would, I presume, if I'd been made that
way."

"Then I'd have remembered it to the last day I lived--and never
forgiven you," said Harvey, his chin on his doubled fists.

"Exactly. That's about what I'd do. You see?"

"I see. The fault's with me and no one else. All the samey, something's
got to be done about it."

Cheyne drew a cigar from his vest-pocket, bit off the end, and fell to
smoking. Father and son were very much alike; for the beard hid
Cheyne's mouth, and Harvey had his father's slightly aquiline nose,
close-set black eyes, and narrow, high cheek-bones. With a touch of
brown paint he would have made up very picturesquely as a Red Indian of
the story-books.

"Now you can go on from here," said Cheyne, slowly, "costing me between
six or eight thousand a year till you're a voter. Well, we'll call you
a man then. You can go right on from that, living on me to the tune of
forty or fifty thousand, besides what your mother will give you, with a
valet and a yacht or a fancy-ranch where you can pretend to raise
trotting stock and play cards with your own crowd."

"Like Lorry Tuck?" Harvey put in.

"Yep; or the two De Vitré boys or old man McQuade's son. California's
full of 'em, and here's an Eastern sample while we're talking."

A shiny black steam-yacht, with mahogany deck-house, nickel-plated
binnacles, and pink-and-white-striped awnings, puffed up the harbour,
flying the burgee of some New York club. Two young men, in what they
conceived to be sea costumes, were playing cards by the saloon
skylight; and a couple of women with red and blue parasols looked on
and laughed noisily.

"Shouldn't care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze. No,
beam," said Harvey, critically, as the yacht slowed to pick up her
mooring-buoy.

"They're having what stands them for a good time. I can give you that,
and twice as much as that, Harve. How'd you like it?"

"Caesar! That's no way to get a dinghy over-side," said Harvey, still
intent on the yacht. "If I couldn't slip a tackle better than that I'd
stay ashore. . . . What if I don't?"

"Stay ashore--or what?"

"Yacht and ranch and live on 'the old man,' and--get behind mama when
there's trouble," said Harvey, with a twinkle in his eye.

"Why, in that case, you come right in with me, my son."

"Ten dollars a month?" Another twinkle.

"Not a cent more until you're worth it, and you won't begin to touch
that for a few years."

"I'd sooner begin sweeping out the office--isn't that how the big bugs
start?--and touch something now than--"

"I know it; we all feel that way. But I guess we can hire any sweeping
we need. I made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon."

"Thirty million dollars' worth o' mistake, wasn't it? I'd risk it for
that."

"I lost some; and I gained some. I'll tell you."

Cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water,
and spoke away from Harvey, who presently began to be aware that his
father was telling the story of his life. He talked in a low, even
voice, without gesture and without expression; and it was a history for
which a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many
dollars--the story of forty years that was at the same time the story
of the New West, whose story is yet to be written.

It began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas, and went on
fantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life, the scenes
shifting from State after Western State, from cities that sprang up in
a month and in a season utterly withered away, to wild ventures in
wilder camps that are now laborious, paved municipalities. It covered
the building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth.
It told of steamers, townships, forests, and mines, and the men of
every nation under heaven, manning, creating, hewing, and digging
these. It touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that
could not see, or missed by the merest accident of time and travel; and
through the mad shift of things, sometimes on horseback, more often
afoot, now rich, now poor, in and out, and back and forth, deck-hand,
train-hand, contractor, boardinghouse keeper, journalist, engineer,
drummer, real-estate agent, politician, dead-beat, rumseller,
mine-owner, speculator, cattle-man, or tramp, moved Harvey Cheyne,
alert and quiet, seeking his own ends, and, so he said, the glory and
advancement of his country.

He told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the
ragged edge of despair the faith that comes of knowing men and things.
He enlarged, as though he were talking to himself, on his very great
courage and resource at all times. The thing was so evident in the
man's mind that he never even changed his tone. He described how he had
bested his enemies, or forgiven them, exactly as they had bested or
forgiven him in those careless days; how he had entreated, cajoled, and
bullied towns, companies, and syndicates, all for their enduring good;
crawled round, through, or under mountains and ravines, dragging a
string and hoop-iron railroad after him, and in the end, how he had sat
still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his
character to shreds.

The tale held Harvey almost breathless, his head a little cocked to one
side, his eyes fixed on his father's face, as the twilight deepened and
the red cigar-end lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows. It
seemed to him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the
dark--a mile between each glare of the opened fire-door: but this
locomotive could talk, and the words shook and stirred the boy to the
core of his soul. At last Cheyne pitched away the cigar-butt, and the
two sat in the dark over the lapping water.

"I've never told that to any one before," said the father.

Harvey gasped. "It's just the greatest thing that ever was!" said he.

"That's what I got. Now I'm coming to what I didn't get. It won't sound
much of anything to you, but I don't wish you to be as old as I am
before you find out. I can handle men, of course, and I'm no fool along
my own lines, but--but I can't compete with the man who has been
taught! I've picked up as I went along, and I guess it sticks out all
over me."

"I've never seen it," said the son, indignantly.

"You will, though, Harve. You will--just as soon as you're through
college. Don't I know it? Don't I know the look on men's faces when
they think me a--a 'mucker,' as they call it out here? I can break them
to little pieces--yes--but I can't get back at 'em to hurt 'em where
they live. I don't say they're 'way, 'way up, but I feel I'm 'way,
'way, 'way off, somehow. Now you've got your chance. You've got to soak
up all the learning that's around, and you'll live with a crowd that
are doing the same thing. They'll be doing it for a few thousand
dollars a year at most; but remember you'll be doing it for millions.
You'll learn law enough to look after your own property when I'm out o'
the light, and you'll have to be solid with the best men in the market
(they are useful later); and above all, you'll have to stow away the
plain, common, sit-down-with-your-chin-on-your-elbows book-learning.
Nothing pays like that, Harve, and it's bound to pay more and more each
year in our country--in business and in politics. You'll see."

"There's no sugar my end of the deal," said Harvey. "Four years at
college! Wish I'd chosen the valet and the yacht!"

"Never mind, my son," Cheyne insisted. "You're investing your capital
where it'll bring in the best returns; and I guess you won't find our
property shrunk any when you're ready to take hold. Think it over, and
let me know in the morning. Hurry! We'll be late for supper!"

As this was a business talk, there was no need for Harvey to tell his
mother about it; and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view. But
Mrs. Cheyne saw and feared, and was a little jealous. Her boy, who rode
rough-shod over her, was gone, and in his stead reigned a keen-faced
youth, abnormally silent, who addressed most of his conversation to his
father. She understood it was business, and therefore a matter beyond
her premises. If she had any doubts, they were resolved when Cheyne
went to Boston and brought back a new diamond marquise-ring.

"What have you two men been doing now?" she said, with a weak little
smile, as she turned it in the light.

"Talking--just talking, mama; there's nothing mean about Harvey."

There was not. The boy had made a treaty on his own account. Railroads,
he explained gravely, interested him as little as lumber, real estate,
or mining. What his soul yearned after was control of his father's
newly purchased sailing-ships. If that could be promised him within
what he conceived to be a reasonable time, he, for his part, guaranteed
diligence and sobriety at college for four or five years. In vacation
he was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the
line,--he had asked not more than two thousand questions about
it,--from his father's most private papers in the safe to the tug in
San Francisco harbour.

"It's a deal," said Cheyne at the last. "You'll alter your mind twenty
times before you leave college, o' course; but if you take hold of it
in proper shape, and if you don't tie it up before you're twenty-three,
I'll make the thing over to you. How's that, Harve?"

"Nope; never pays to split up a going concern There's too much
competition in the world anyway, and Disko says 'blood-kin hev to stick
together.' His crowd never go back on him. That's one reason, he says,
why they make such big fares. Say, the "We're Here" goes off to the
Georges on Monday. They don't stay long ashore, do they?"

"Well, we ought to be going, too, I guess. I've left my business hung
up at loose ends between two oceans, and it's time to connect again. I
just hate to do it, though; haven't had a holiday like this for twenty
years."

"We can't go without seeing Disko off," said Harvey; "and Monday's
Memorial Day. Let's stay over that, anyway."

"What is this memorial business? They were talking about it at the
boarding-house," said Cheyne, weakly. He, too, was not anxious to spoil
the golden days.

"Well, as far as I can make out, this business is a sort of
song-and-dance act, whacked up for the summer boarders. Disko don't
think much of it, he says, because they take up a collection for the
widows and orphans. Disko's independent. Haven't you noticed that?"

"Well--yes. A little. In spots. Is it a town show, then?"

"The summer convention is. They read out the names of the fellows
drowned or gone astray since last time, and they make speeches, and
recite, and all. Then, Disko says, the secretaries of the Aid Societies
go into the back yard and fight over the catch. The real show, he says,
is in the spring. The ministers all take a hand then, and there aren't
any summer boarders around."

"I see," said Cheyne, with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of
one born into and bred up to city pride. "We'll stay over for Memorial
Day, and get off in the afternoon."

"Guess I'll go down to Disko's and make him bring his crowd up before
they sail. I'll have to stand with them, of course."

"Oh, that's it, is it," said Cheyne. "I'm only a poor summer boarder,
and  you're--"

"A Banker--full-blooded Banker," Harvey called back as he boarded a
trolley, and Cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future.

Disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for
charity, but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost, so
far as he was concerned, if the "We're Heres" absented themselves. Then
Disko made conditions. He had heard--it was astonishing how all the
world knew all the world's business along the waterfront--he had heard
that a "Philadelphia actress-woman" was going to take part in the
exercises; and he mistrusted that she would deliver "Skipper Ireson's
Ride." Personally, he had as little use for actresses as for summer
boarders; but justice was justice, and though he himself (here Dan
giggled) had once slipped up on a matter of judgment, this thing must
not be. So Harvey came back to East Gloucester, and spent half a day
explaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two
seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she contemplated; and she
admitted that it was justice, even as Disko had said.

Cheyne knew by old experience what would happen; but anything of the
nature of a public palaver was meat and drink to the man's soul. He saw
the trolleys hurrying west, in the hot, hazy morning, full of women in
light summer dresses, and white-faced straw-hatted men fresh from
Boston desks; the stack of bicycles outside the post-office; the
come-and-go of busy officials, greeting one another; the slow flick and
swash of bunting in the heavy air; and the important man with a hose
sluicing the brick sidewalk.

"Mother," he said suddenly, "don't you remember--after Seattle was
burned out--and they got her going again?"

Mrs. Cheyne nodded, and looked critically down the crooked street. Like
her husband, she understood these gatherings, all the West over, and
compared them one against another. The fishermen began to mingle with
the crowd about the town-hall doors--blue-jowled Portuguese, their
women bare-headed or shawled for the most part; clear-eyed Nova
Scotians, and men of the Maritime Provinces; French, Italians, Swedes,
and Danes, with outside crews of coasting schooners; and everywhere
women in black, who saluted one another with a gloomy pride, for this
was their day of great days. And there were ministers of many
creeds,--pastors of great, gilt-edged congregations, at the seaside for
a rest, with shepherds of the regular work,--from the priests of the
Church on the Hill to bush-bearded ex-sailor Lutherans, hail-fellow
with the men of a score of boats. There were owners of lines of
schooners, large contributors to the societies, and small men, their
few craft pawned to the mastheads, with bankers and marine-insurance
agents, captains of tugs and water-boats, riggers, fitters, lumpers,
salters, boat-builders, and coopers, and all the mixed population of
the water-front.

They drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the
summer boarders, and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired
till he shone all over with pure civic pride. Cheyne had met him for
five minutes a few days before, and between the two there was entire
understanding.

"Well, Mr. Cheyne, and what d'you think of our city?--Yes, madam, you
can sit anywhere you please.--You have this kind of thing out West, I
presume?"

"Yes, but we aren't as old as you."

"That's so, of course. You ought to have been at the exercises when we
celebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday. I tell you, Mr.
Cheyne, the old city did herself credit."

"So I heard. It pays, too. What's the matter with the town that it
don't have a first-class hotel, though?"

"Right over there to the left, Pedro. Heaps o' room for you and your
crowd.--Why, that's what I tell 'em all the time, Mr. Cheyne. There's
big money in it, but I presume that don't affect you any. What we want
is--"

A heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder, and the flushed skipper
of a Portland coal-and-ice coaster spun him half round. "What in
thunder do you fellows mean by clappin' the law on the town when all
decent men are at sea this way? Heh? Town's dry's a bone, an' smells a
sight worse sence I quit. 'Might ha' left us one saloon for soft
drinks, anyway."

"Don't seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning, Carsen.
I'll go into the politics of it later. Sit down by the door and think
over your arguments till I come back."

"What good's arguments to me? In Miquelon champagne's eighteen dollars
a case, and--" The skipper lurched into his seat as an organ-prelude
silenced him.

"Our new organ," said the official proudly to Cheyne. "Cost us four
thousand dollars, too. We'll have to get back to high-licence next year
to pay for it. I wasn't going to let the ministers have all the
religion at their convention. Those are some of our orphans standing up
to sing. My wife taught 'em. See you again later, Mr. Cheyne. I'm
wanted on the platform."

High, clear, and true, children's voices bore down the last noise of
those settling into their places.

"O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify
him for ever!"

The women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated
cadences filled the air. Mrs. Cheyne, with some others, began to
breathe short; she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the
world; and instinctively searched for Harvey. He had found the "We're
Heres" at the back of the audience, and was standing, as by right,
between Dan and Disko. Uncle Salters, returned the night before with
Penn, from Pamlico Sound, received him suspiciously.

"Hain't your folk gone yet?" he grunted. "What are you doin' here,
young feller?"

"O ye Seas and Floods, bless ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him
for ever!"

"Hain't he good right?" said Dan. "He's bin there, same as the rest of
us."

"Not in them clothes," Salters snarled.

"Shut your head, Salters," said Disko. "Your bile's gone back on you.
Stay right where ye are, Harve."

Then up and spoke the orator of the occasion, another pillar of the
municipality, bidding the world welcome to Gloucester, and incidentally
pointing out wherein Gloucester excelled the rest of the world. Then he
turned to the sea-wealth of the city, and spoke of the price that must
be paid for the yearly harvest. They would hear later the names of
their lost dead--one hundred and seventeen of them. (The widows stared
a little, and looked at one another here.) Gloucester could not boast
any overwhelming mills or factories. Her sons worked for such wage as
the sea gave; and they all knew that neither Georges nor the Banks were
cow-pastures. The utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help
the widows and the orphans; and after a few general remarks he took
this opportunity of thanking, in the name of the city, those who had so
public-spiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the
occasion.

"I jest despise the beggin' pieces in it," growled Disko. "It don't
give folk a fair notion of us."

"Ef folk won't be fore-handed an' put by when they've the chance,"
returned Salters, "it stands in the nature o' things they hev to be
'shamed. You take warnin' by that, young feller. Riches endureth but
for a season, ef you scatter them araound on lugsuries--"

"But to lose everything--everything," said Penn. "What can you do then?
Once!"--the watery blue eyes stared up and down, as looking for
something to steady them--"once I read--in a book, I think--of a boat
where every one was run down--except some one--and he said to me--"

"Shucks!" said Salters, cutting in. "You read a little less an' take
more int'rust in your vittles, and you'll come nearer earnin' your
keep, Penn."

Harvey, jammed among the fishermen, felt a creepy, crawly, tingling
thrill that began in the back of his neck and ended at his boots. He
was cold, too, though it was a stifling day.

"'That the actress from Philadelphia?" said Disko Troop, scowling at
the platform. "You've fixed it about old man Ireson, hain't ye, Harve?
Ye know why naow."

It was not "Ireson's Ride" that the woman delivered, but some sort of
poem about a fishing-port called Brixham and a fleet of trawlers
beating in against storm by night, while the women made a guiding fire
at the head of the quay with everything they could lay hands on.

  "They took the grandam's blanket,
  Who shivered and bade them go;
  They took the baby's cradle,
  Who could not say them no."

"Whew!" said Dan, peering over Long Jack's shoulder. "That's great!
Must ha' bin expensive, though."

"Ground-hog case," said the Galway man. "Badly lighted port, Danny."

  "And knew not all the while
  If they were lighting a bonfire
  Or only a funeral pile."

The wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings; and when
she told how the drenched crews were flung ashore, living and dead, and
they carried the bodies to the glare of the fires, asking: "Child, is
this your father?" or "Wife, is this your man?" you could hear hard
breathing all over the benches.

  "And when the boats of Brixham
  Go out to face the gales,
  Think of the love that travels
  Like light upon their sails!"


There was very little applause when she finished. The women were
looking for their handkerchiefs, and many of the men stared at the
ceiling with shiny eyes.

"H'm," said Salters; "that 'u'd cost ye a dollar to hear at any
theater--maybe two. Some folk, I presoom, can afford it. 'Seems
downright waste to me. . . . Naow, how in Jerusalem did Cap Bart
Edwardes strike adrift here?"

"No keepin' him under," said an Eastport man behind. "He's a poet, an'
he's baound to say his piece. 'Comes from daown aour way, too."

He did not say that Captain B. Edwardes had striven for five
consecutive years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own
composition on Gloucester Memorial Day. An amused and exhausted
committee had at last given him his desire. The simplicity and utter
happiness of the old man, as he stood up in his very best Sunday
clothes, won the audience ere he opened his mouth. They sat unmurmuring
through seven-and-thirty hatchet-made verses describing at fullest
length the loss of the schooner Joan Hasken off the Georges in the gale
of 1867, and when he came to an end they shouted with one kindly throat.

A far-sighted Boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and
an interview with the author; so that earth had nothing more to offer
Captain Bart Edwardes, ex-whaler, shipwright, master-fisherman, and
poet, in the seventy-third year of his age.

"Naow, I call that sensible," said an Eastport man. "I've bin over that
graound with his writin', jest as he read it, in my two hands, and I
can testify that he's got it all in."

"If Dan here couldn't do better'n that with one hand before breakfast,
he ought to be switched," said Salters, upholding the honour of
Massachusetts on general principles. "Not but what I'm free to own he's
considerable litt'ery--fer Maine. Still--"

"Guess Uncle Salters's goin' to die this trip. Fust compliment he's
ever paid me," Dan sniggered. "What's wrong with you, Harve? You act
all quiet and you look greenish. Feelin' sick?"

"Don't know what's the matter with me," Harvey replied. "Seems if my
insides were too big for my outsides. I'm all crowded up and shivery."

"Dispepsy? Pshaw-too bad. We'll wait for the readin', an' then we'll
quit, an' catch the tide."

The widows--they were nearly all of that season's making--braced
themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood, for they
knew what was coming. The summer-boarder girls in pink and blue
shirt-waists stopped tittering over Captain Edwardes's wonderful poem,
and looked back to see why all was silent. The fishermen pressed
forward as that town official who had talked with Cheyne bobbed up on
the platform and began to read the year's list of losses, dividing them
into months. Last September's casualties were mostly single men and
strangers, but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall.

"September 9th.--Schooner "Florrie Anderson" lost, with all aboard, off
the Georges. "Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, Main Street, City.
"Emil Olsen, 19, single, 329 Hammond Street, City; Denmark. "Oscar
Stanberg, single, 25, Sweden. "Carl Stanberg, single, 28, Main Street,
City. "Pedro, supposed Madeira, single, Keene's boarding-house, City.
"Joseph Welsh, alias Joseph Wright, 30, St. John's, Newfoundland."

"No--Augusty, Maine," a voice cried from the body of the hall.

"He shipped from St. John's," said the reader, looking to see.

"I know it. He belongs in Augusty. My nevvy."

The reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list, and
resumed:

"Same schooner, Charlie Ritchie, Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 33, single.
"Albert May, 267 Rogers Street, City, 27, single. "September
27th.--Orvin Dollard, 30, married, drowned in dory off Eastern Point."

That shot went home, for one of the widows flinched where she sat,
clasping and unclasping her hands. Mrs. Cheyne, who had been listening
with wide-opened eyes, threw up her head and choked. Dan's mother, a
few seats to the right, saw and heard and quickly moved to her side.
The reading went on. By the time they reached the January and February
wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast, and the widows drew
breath between their teeth.

"February 14th.--Schooner "Harry Randolph" dismasted on the way home
from Newfoundland; Asa Musie, married, 32, Main Street, City, lost
overboard.

"February 23d.--Schooner "Gilbert Hope"; went astray in
dory, Robert Beavon, 29, married, native of Pubnico, Nova Scotia."


But his wife was in the hall. They heard a low cry, as though a little
animal had been hit. It was stifled at once, and a girl staggered out
of the hall. She had been hoping against hope for months, because some
who have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by
deep-sea sailing-ships. Now she had her certainty, and Harvey could see
the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her. "It's fifty cents
to the depot"--the driver began, but the policeman held up his
hand--"but I'm goin' there anyway. Jump right in. Look at here, Alf;
you don't pull me next time my lamps ain't lit. See?"

The side-door closed on the patch of bright sunshine, and Harvey's eyes
turned again to the reader and his endless list.

"April 19th.--Schooner "Mamie Douglas" lost on the Banks with all
hands. "Edward Canton," 43, master, married, City. "D. Hawkins," alias
Williams, 34, married, Shelbourne, Nova Scotia. "G. W. Clay," coloured,
28, married, City."

And so on, and so on. Great lumps were rising in Harvey's throat, and
his stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner.

"May 10th.--Schooner "We're Here" [the blood tingled all over him].
Otto Svendson, 20, single, City, lost overboard."

Once more a low, tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall.

"She shouldn't ha' come. She shouldn't ha' come," said Long Jack, with
a cluck of pity. "Don't scrowge, Harve," grunted Dan. Harvey heard that
much, but the rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels. Disko
leaned forward and spoke to his wife, where she sat with one arm round
Mrs. Cheyne, and the other holding down the snatching, catching, ringed
hands.

"Lean your head daown--right daown!" she whispered. "It'll go off in a
minute."

"I ca-an't! I do-don't! Oh, let me--" Mrs. Cheyne did not at all know
what she said.

"You must," Mrs. Troop repeated. "Your boy's jest fainted dead away.
They do that some when they're gettin' their growth. 'Wish to tend to
him? We can git aout this side. Quite quiet. You come right along with
me. Psha', my dear, we're both women, I guess. We must tend to aour
men-folk. Come!"

The "We're Heres" promptly went through the crowd as a body-guard, and
it was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up on a bench
in an anteroom.

"Favours his ma," was Mrs. Troop's only comment, as the mother bent
over her boy.

"How d'you suppose he could ever stand it?" she cried indignantly to
Cheyne, who had said nothing at all. "It was horrible--horrible! We
shouldn't have come. It's wrong and wicked! It--it isn't right!
Why--why couldn't they put these things in the papers, where they
belong? Are you better, darling?"

That made Harvey very properly ashamed. "Oh, I'm all right, I guess,"
he said, struggling to his feet, with a broken giggle. "Must ha' been
something I ate for breakfast."

"Coffee, perhaps," said Cheyne, whose face was all in hard lines, as
though it had been cut out of bronze. "We won't go back again."

"Guess 'twould be 'baout's well to git daown to the wharf," said Disko.
"It's close in along with them Dagoes, an' the fresh air will fresh
Mrs. Cheyne up."

Harvey announced that he never felt better in his life; but it was not
till he saw the "We're Here", fresh from the lumper's hands, at
Wouverman's wharf, that he lost his all-overish feelings in a queer
mixture of pride and sorrowfulness. Other people--summer boarders and
such-like--played about in cat-boats or looked at the sea from
pier-heads; but he understood things from the inside--more things than
he could begin to think about. None the less, he could have sat down
and howled because the little schooner was going off. Mrs. Cheyne
simply cried and cried every step of the way, and said most
extraordinary things to Mrs. Troop, who "babied" her till Dan, who had
not been "babied" since he was six, whistled aloud.

And so the old crowd--Harvey felt like the most ancient of
mariners--dropped into the old schooner among the battered dories,
while Harvey slipped the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they slid
her along the wharf-side with their hands. Every one wanted to say so
much that no one said anything in particular. Harvey bade Dan take care
of Uncle Salters's sea-boots and Penn's dory-anchor, and Long Jack
entreated Harvey to remember his lessons in seamanship; but the jokes
fell flat in the presence of the two women, and it is hard to be funny
with green harbour-water widening between good friends.

"Up jib and fores'l!" shouted Disko, getting to the wheel, as the wind
took her. "See you later, Harve. Dunno but I come near thinkin' a heap
o' you an' your folks."

Then she glided beyond ear-shot, and they sat down to watch her up the
harbour. And still Mrs. Cheyne wept.

"Psha', my dear," said Mrs. Troop; "we're both women, I guess. Like's
not it'll ease your heart to hev your cry aout. God He knows it never
done me a mite o' good; but then He knows I've had something to cry
fer!"

Now it was a few years later, and upon the other edge of America, that
a young man came through the clammy sea-fog up a windy street which is
flanked with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone. To
him, as he was standing by a hammered iron gate, entered on
horseback--and the horse would have been cheap at a thousand
dollars--another young man. And this is what they said:

"Hello, Dan!"

"Hello, Harve!"

"What's the best with you?"

"Well, I'm so's to be that kind o' animal called second mate this trip.
Ain't you most through with that triple-invoiced college o' yours?"

"Getting that way. I tell you, the Leland Stanford Junior isn't a
circumstance to the old "We're Here"; but I'm coming into the business
for keeps next fall."

"Meanin' aour packets?"

"Nothing else. You just wait till I get my knife into you, Dan. I'm
going to make the old line lie down and cry when I take hold."

"I'll resk it," said Dan, with a brotherly grin, as Harvey dismounted
and asked whether he were coming in.

"That's what I took the cable fer; but, say, is the doctor anywheres
araound? I'll draown that crazy nigger some day, his one cussed joke
an' all."

There was a low, triumphant chuckle, as the ex-cook of the "We're Here"
came out of the fog to take the horse's bridle. He allowed no one but
himself to attend to any of Harvey's wants.

"Thick as the Banks, ain't it, doctor?" said Dan, propitiatingly.

But the coal-black Celt with the second-sight did not see fit to reply
till he had tapped Dan on the shoulder, and for the twentieth time
croaked the old, old prophecy in his ear:

"Master--man. Man--master," said he. "You remember, Dan Troop, what I
said? On the 'We're Here'?"

"Well, I won't go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things
stand at present," said Dan. "She was an able packet, and one way an'
another I owe her a heap--her and dad."

"Me too," quoth Harvey Cheyne.




Mowgli's Brothers

     Now Rann the Kite brings home the night
        That Mang the Bat sets free--
     The herds are shut in byre and hut
        For loosed till dawn are we.
     This is the hour of pride and power,
        Talon and tush and claw.
     Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all
        That keep the Jungle Law!
     Night-Song in the Jungle

It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and
spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling
in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her
four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the
cave where they all lived. "Augrh!" said Father Wolf. "It is time to
hunt again." He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with
a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: "Good luck go with you, O
Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
children that they may never forget the hungry in this world."

It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India
despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling
tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more
than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets
that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting
everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui
goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake
a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the
madness--and run.

"Enter, then, and look," said Father Wolf stiffly, "but there is no food
here."

"For a wolf, no," said Tabaqui, "but for so mean a person as myself a
dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people],
to pick and choose?" He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he
found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end
merrily.

"All thanks for this good meal," he said, licking his lips. "How
beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young
too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings
are men from the beginning."

Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so
unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see
Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.

Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then
he said spitefully:

"Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt
among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me."

Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty
miles away.

"He has no right!" Father Wolf began angrily--"By the Law of the Jungle
he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will
frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for
two, these days."

"His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing," said
Mother Wolf quietly. "He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That
is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are
angry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry.
They will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our
children must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very
grateful to Shere Khan!"

"Shall I tell him of your gratitude?" said Tabaqui.

"Out!" snapped Father Wolf. "Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast
done harm enough for one night."

"I go," said Tabaqui quietly. "Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the
thickets. I might have saved myself the message."

Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little
river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has
caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.

"The fool!" said Father Wolf. "To begin a night's work with that noise!
Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?"

"H'sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night," said Mother
Wolf. "It is Man."

The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come
from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders
woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run
sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.

"Man!" said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. "Faugh! Are there
not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on
our ground too!"

The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,
forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his
children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds
of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing
means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with
guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.
Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among
themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living
things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is
true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.

The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated "Aaarh!" of the
tiger's charge.

Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. "He has
missed," said Mother Wolf. "What is it?"

Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and
mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub.

"The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter's campfire,
and has burned his feet," said Father Wolf with a grunt. "Tabaqui is
with him."

"Something is coming uphill," said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. "Get
ready."

The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped
with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been
watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the
wolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before he saw what it was
he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was
that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing
almost where he left ground.

"Man!" he snapped. "A man's cub. Look!"

Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked
brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom
as ever came to a wolf's cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolf's
face, and laughed.

"Is that a man's cub?" said Mother Wolf. "I have never seen one. Bring
it here."

A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg
without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the
child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down
among the cubs.

"How little! How naked, and--how bold!" said Mother Wolf softly. The
baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.
"Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man's
cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub among
her children?"

"I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in
my time," said Father Wolf. "He is altogether without hair, and I
could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not
afraid."

The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan's
great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui,
behind him, was squeaking: "My lord, my lord, it went in here!"

"Shere Khan does us great honor," said Father Wolf, but his eyes were
very angry. "What does Shere Khan need?"

"My quarry. A man's cub went this way," said Shere Khan. "Its parents
have run off. Give it to me."

Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter's campfire, as Father Wolf had
said, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf
knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in
by. Even where he was, Shere Khan's shoulders and forepaws were cramped
for want of room, as a man's would be if he tried to fight in a barrel.

"The Wolves are a free people," said Father Wolf. "They take orders from
the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man's
cub is ours--to kill if we choose."

"Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the
bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair
dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!"

The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself
clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in
the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.

"And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man's cub is mine,
Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with
the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of
little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now get
hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back
thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever
thou camest into the world! Go!"

Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he
won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in
the Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment's sake. Shere Khan
might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother
Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the
ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth
growling, and when he was clear he shouted:

"Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to
this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will
come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!"

Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf
said to her gravely:

"Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack.
Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?"

"Keep him!" she gasped. "He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry;
yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side
already. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run
off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our
lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little
frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will
come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee."

"But what will our Pack say?" said Father Wolf.

The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he
marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs
are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack
Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order
that the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs
are free to run where they please, and until they have killed their
first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one
of them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if
you think for a minute you will see that this must be so.

Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the
night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the
Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred
wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack
by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and
below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from
badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black
three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a
year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he
had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs
of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over
each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers
sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look
at him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a
mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that
he had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: "Ye know
the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!" And the anxious mothers
would take up the call: "Look--look well, O Wolves!"

At last--and Mother Wolf's neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father
Wolf pushed "Mowgli the Frog," as they called him, into the center,
where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in
the moonlight.

Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the
monotonous cry: "Look well!" A muffled roar came up from behind the
rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: "The cub is mine. Give him to
me. What have the Free People to do with a man's cub?" Akela never even
twitched his ears. All he said was: "Look well, O Wolves! What have
the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look
well!"

There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year
flung back Shere Khan's question to Akela: "What have the Free People to
do with a man's cub?" Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there
is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he
must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his
father and mother.

"Who speaks for this cub?" said Akela. "Among the Free People who
speaks?" There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew
would be her last fight, if things came to fighting.

Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo,
the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle:
old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only
nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.

"The man's cub--the man's cub?" he said. "I speak for the man's cub.
There is no harm in a man's cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak
the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I
myself will teach him."

"We need yet another," said Akela. "Baloo has spoken, and he is our
teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?"

A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black
Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing
up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew
Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as
Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded
elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree,
and a skin softer than down.

"O Akela, and ye the Free People," he purred, "I have no right in your
assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which
is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may
be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay
that price. Am I right?"

"Good! Good!" said the young wolves, who are always hungry. "Listen to
Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law."

"Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave."

"Speak then," cried twenty voices.

"To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you
when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo's word
I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile
from here, if ye will accept the man's cub according to the Law. Is it
difficult?"

There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: "What matter? He will
die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can
a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull,
Bagheera? Let him be accepted." And then came Akela's deep bay, crying:
"Look well--look well, O Wolves!"

Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice
when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went
down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and
Mowgli's own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for
he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.

"Ay, roar well," said Bagheera, under his whiskers, "for the time will
come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I
know nothing of man."

"It was well done," said Akela. "Men and their cubs are very wise. He
may be a help in time."

"Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack
forever," said Bagheera.

Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every
leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler
and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader
comes up--to be killed in his turn.

"Take him away," he said to Father Wolf, "and train him as befits one of
the Free People."

And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the
price of a bull and on Baloo's good word.

Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only
guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves,
because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He
grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost
before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the
meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every
breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head,
every scratch of a bat's claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and
every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much
to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was
not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep
again. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and
when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as
pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera
showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, "Come
along, Little Brother," and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth,
but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as
boldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too,
when the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any
wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare
for fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads
of his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their
coats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night,
and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a
mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop
gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it,
and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to
go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all
through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his
killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did
Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand
things, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had
been bought into the Pack at the price of a bull's life. "All the jungle
is thine," said Bagheera, "and thou canst kill everything that thou art
strong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee
thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of
the Jungle." Mowgli obeyed faithfully.

And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that
he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of
except things to eat.

Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature
to be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan. But though a
young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot
it because he was only a boy--though he would have called himself a wolf
if he had been able to speak in any human tongue.

Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew
older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the
younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela
would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the
proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such
fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man's
cub. "They tell me," Shere Khan would say, "that at Council ye dare
not look him between the eyes." And the young wolves would growl and
bristle.

Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and
once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill
him some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: "I have the Pack and I have
thee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my
sake. Why should I be afraid?"

It was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of
something that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told him;
but he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy lay
with his head on Bagheera's beautiful black skin, "Little Brother, how
often have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?"

"As many times as there are nuts on that palm," said Mowgli, who,
naturally, could not count. "What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and
Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock."

"But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack
know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee
too."

"Ho! ho!" said Mowgli. "Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude
talk that I was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts. But I
caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm-tree to
teach him better manners."

"That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he would
have told thee of something that concerned thee closely. Open those
eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But
remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot kill
his buck, and then he will be leader no more. Many of the wolves that
looked thee over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old
too, and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that
a man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou wilt be a
man."

"And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?" said
Mowgli. "I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle,
and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn.
Surely they are my brothers!"

Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes.
"Little Brother," said he, "feel under my jaw."

Mowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera's silky
chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair,
he came upon a little bald spot.

"There is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry that
mark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was born among
men, and it was among men that my mother died--in the cages of the
king's palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that I paid the price
for thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too
was born among men. I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind
bars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the
Panther--and no man's plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one
blow of my paw and came away. And because I had learned the ways of men,
I became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?"

"Yes," said Mowgli, "all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli."

"Oh, thou art a man's cub," said the Black Panther very tenderly. "And
even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to
the men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council."

"But why--but why should any wish to kill me?" said Mowgli.

"Look at me," said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him steadily between
the eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.

"That is why," he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. "Not even I can
look thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love thee,
Little Brother. The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet
thine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out thorns from
their feet--because thou art a man."

"I did not know these things," said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned
under his heavy black eyebrows.

"What is the Law of the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By
thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise. It is
in my heart that when Akela misses his next kill--and at each hunt
it costs him more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him and
against thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock, and then--and
then--I have it!" said Bagheera, leaping up. "Go thou down quickly to
the men's huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they
grow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger
friend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love thee. Get the Red
Flower."

By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will
call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it,
and invents a hundred ways of describing it.

"The Red Flower?" said Mowgli. "That grows outside their huts in the
twilight. I will get some."

"There speaks the man's cub," said Bagheera proudly. "Remember that it
grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of
need."

"Good!" said Mowgli. "I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera"--he
slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big
eyes--"art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan's doing?"

"By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother."

"Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for
this, and it may be a little over," said Mowgli, and he bounded away.

"That is a man. That is all a man," said Bagheera to himself, lying down
again. "Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt
of thine ten years ago!"

Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his heart
was hot in him. He came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew
breath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother
Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that something was
troubling her frog.

"What is it, Son?" she said.

"Some bat's chatter of Shere Khan," he called back. "I hunt among the
plowed fields tonight," and he plunged downward through the bushes, to
the stream at the bottom of the valley. There he checked, for he heard
the yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur,
and the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter
howls from the young wolves: "Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show his
strength. Room for the leader of the Pack! Spring, Akela!"

The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard the
snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with
his forefoot.

He did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew
fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers
lived.

"Bagheera spoke truth," he panted, as he nestled down in some cattle
fodder by the window of a hut. "To-morrow is one day both for Akela and
for me."

Then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on
the hearth. He saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the night
with black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white
and cold, he saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside
with earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his
blanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre.

"Is that all?" said Mowgli. "If a cub can do it, there is nothing to
fear." So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from
his hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.

"They are very like me," said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had
seen the woman do. "This thing will die if I do not give it things to
eat"; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up
the hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on
his coat.

"Akela has missed," said the Panther. "They would have killed him last
night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the
hill."

"I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!" Mowgli held up the
fire-pot.

"Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and
presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not
afraid?"

"No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how,
before I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and
pleasant."

All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping
dry branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that
satisfied him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told
him rudely enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he laughed
till Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing.

Akela the Lone Wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the
leadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his following of
scrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera lay
close to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgli's knees. When they
were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing he would
never have dared to do when Akela was in his prime.

"He has no right," whispered Bagheera. "Say so. He is a dog's son. He
will be frightened."

Mowgli sprang to his feet. "Free People," he cried, "does Shere Khan
lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?"

"Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--"
Shere Khan began.

"By whom?" said Mowgli. "Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle
butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone."

There were yells of "Silence, thou man's cub!" "Let him speak. He has
kept our Law"; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: "Let the
Dead Wolf speak." When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is
called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.

Akela raised his old head wearily:--

"Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I
have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been
trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that plot
was made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my
weakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on
the Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the
Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come
one by one."

There was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to
the death. Then Shere Khan roared: "Bah! What have we to do with this
toothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived too
long. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me. I
am weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the jungle for ten
seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give
you one bone. He is a man, a man's child, and from the marrow of my
bones I hate him!"

Then more than half the Pack yelled: "A man! A man! What has a man to do
with us? Let him go to his own place."

"And turn all the people of the villages against us?" clamored Shere
Khan. "No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him
between the eyes."

Akela lifted his head again and said, "He has eaten our food. He has
slept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the
Law of the Jungle."

"Also, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a
bull is little, but Bagheera's honor is something that he will perhaps
fight for," said Bagheera in his gentlest voice.

"A bull paid ten years ago!" the Pack snarled. "What do we care for
bones ten years old?"

"Or for a pledge?" said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip.
"Well are ye called the Free People!"

"No man's cub can run with the people of the jungle," howled Shere Khan.
"Give him to me!"

"He is our brother in all but blood," Akela went on, "and ye would kill
him here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters of
cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan's teaching,
ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's doorstep.
Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is
certain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer
that in the man-cub's place. But for the sake of the Honor of
the Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader ye have
forgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his own place, I
will not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I will
die without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives.
More I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that comes of
killing a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother spoken for
and bought into the Pack according to the Law of the Jungle."

"He is a man--a man--a man!" snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves
began to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.

"Now the business is in thy hands," said Bagheera to Mowgli. "We can do
no more except fight."

Mowgli stood upright--the fire pot in his hands. Then he stretched out
his arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he was furious with
rage and sorrow, for, wolflike, the wolves had never told him how they
hated him. "Listen you!" he cried. "There is no need for this dog's
jabber. Ye have told me so often tonight that I am a man (and indeed I
would have been a wolf with you to my life's end) that I feel your words
are true. So I do not call ye my brothers any more, but sag [dogs], as
a man should. What ye will do, and what ye will not do, is not yours
to say. That matter is with me; and that we may see the matter more
plainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of the Red Flower which
ye, dogs, fear."

He flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit
a tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in
terror before the leaping flames.

Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and
crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves.

"Thou art the master," said Bagheera in an undertone. "Save Akela from
the death. He was ever thy friend."

Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave
one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black
hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that
made the shadows jump and quiver.

"Good!" said Mowgli, staring round slowly. "I see that ye are dogs. I go
from you to my own people--if they be my own people. The jungle is shut
to me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will be
more merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood,
I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as
ye have betrayed me." He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks
flew up. "There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here
is a debt to pay before I go." He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat
blinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.
Bagheera followed in case of accidents. "Up, dog!" Mowgli cried. "Up,
when a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!"

Shere Khan's ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for
the blazing branch was very near.

"This cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he had
not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs
when we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down
thy gullet!" He beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the
tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear.

"Pah! Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the
Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan's hide
on my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye will
not kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye
will sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were
somebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!" The fire was
burning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right
and left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks
burning their fur. At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps
ten wolves that had taken Mowgli's part. Then something began to hurt
Mowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt in his life before, and he
caught his breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his face.

"What is it? What is it?" he said. "I do not wish to leave the jungle,
and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?"

"No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use," said Bagheera.
"Now I know thou art a man, and a man's cub no longer. The jungle is
shut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only
tears." So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break; and he
had never cried in all his life before.

"Now," he said, "I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to my
mother." And he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and
he cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.

"Ye will not forget me?" said Mowgli.

"Never while we can follow a trail," said the cubs. "Come to the foot of
the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come
into the croplands to play with thee by night."

"Come soon!" said Father Wolf. "Oh, wise little frog, come again soon;
for we be old, thy mother and I."

"Come soon," said Mother Wolf, "little naked son of mine. For, listen,
child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs."

"I will surely come," said Mowgli. "And when I come it will be to lay
out Shere Khan's hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me! Tell them
in the jungle never to forget me!"

The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside
alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.




Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack

     As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
        Once, twice and again!
     And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up
     From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.
     This I, scouting alone, beheld,
        Once, twice and again!

     As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled
        Once, twice and again!
     And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back
     To carry the word to the waiting pack,
     And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track
        Once, twice and again!

     As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled
        Once, twice and again!
     Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!

     Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark!
     Tongue--give tongue to it!  Hark!  O hark!
        Once, twice and again!




Kaa's Hunting

     His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the
        Buffalo's pride.
     Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the
        gloss of his hide.
     If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed
        Sambhur can gore;
     Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons
        before.
     Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister
        and Brother,
     For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is
        their mother.
     "There is none like to me!" says the Cub in the pride of his
        earliest kill;
     But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small.  Let him
        think and be still.
                                 Maxims of Baloo


All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of
the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It
was in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The
big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil,
for the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle
as applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can
repeat the Hunting Verse--"Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in
the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white
teeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the
Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate." But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to
learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther
would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting
on, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the
day's lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could
swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of
the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch
from a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came
upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the
Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the
water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them. None of
the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at
an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers' Hunting Call,
which must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the
Jungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, "Give
me leave to hunt here because I am hungry." And the answer is, "Hunt
then for food, but not for pleasure."

All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he
grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as
Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off
in a temper, "A man's cub is a man's cub, and he must learn all the Law
of the Jungle."

"But think how small he is," said the Black Panther, who would have
spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way. "How can his little head carry
all thy long talk?"

"Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is
why I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly,
when he forgets."

"Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?" Bagheera
grunted. "His face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh."

"Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than
that he should come to harm through ignorance," Baloo answered very
earnestly. "I am now teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that
shall protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all that hunt
on four feet, except his own pack. He can now claim protection, if he
will only remember the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that worth
a little beating?"

"Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub. He is no
tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But what are those Master
Words? I am more likely to give help than to ask it"--Bagheera stretched
out one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end
of it--"still I should like to know."

"I will call Mowgli and he shall say them--if he will. Come, Little
Brother!"

"My head is ringing like a bee tree," said a sullen little voice over
their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant,
adding as he reached the ground: "I come for Bagheera and not for thee,
fat old Baloo!"

"That is all one to me," said Baloo, though he was hurt and grieved.
"Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught
thee this day."

"Master Words for which people?" said Mowgli, delighted to show off.
"The jungle has many tongues. I know them all."

"A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank
their teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank
old Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People,
then--great scholar."

"We be of one blood, ye and I," said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear
accent which all the Hunting People use.

"Good. Now for the birds."

Mowgli repeated, with the Kite's whistle at the end of the sentence.

"Now for the Snake-People," said Bagheera.

The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his
feet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped
on to Bagheera's back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on
the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at Baloo.

"There--there! That was worth a little bruise," said the brown bear
tenderly. "Some day thou wilt remember me." Then he turned aside to
tell Bagheera how he had begged the Master Words from Hathi the Wild
Elephant, who knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken
Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a water-snake, because
Baloo could not pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe
against all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor
beast would hurt him.

"No one then is to be feared," Baloo wound up, patting his big furry
stomach with pride.

"Except his own tribe," said Bagheera, under his breath; and then aloud
to Mowgli, "Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this
dancing up and down?"

Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheera's
shoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him he was
shouting at the top of his voice, "And so I shall have a tribe of my
own, and lead them through the branches all day long."

"What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?" said Bagheera.

"Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo," Mowgli went on. "They
have promised me this. Ah!"

"Whoof!" Baloo's big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera's back, and as the
boy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.

"Mowgli," said Baloo, "thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the
Monkey People."

Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and
Bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones.

"Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people
without a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame."

"When Baloo hurt my head," said Mowgli (he was still on his back), "I
went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on
me. No one else cared." He snuffled a little.

"The pity of the Monkey People!" Baloo snorted. "The stillness of the
mountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?"

"And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and
they--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said
I was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their
leader some day."

"They have no leader," said Bagheera. "They lie. They have always lied."

"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken
among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do
not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad
Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again."

"Listen, man-cub," said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on
a hot night. "I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the
peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.
They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own,
but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are
without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and
pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the
jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all
is forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not
drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do
not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever
heard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?"

"No," said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo
had finished.

"The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds.
They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they
have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not
notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads."

He had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down
through the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and
angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.

"The Monkey-People are forbidden," said Baloo, "forbidden to the
Jungle-People. Remember."

"Forbidden," said Bagheera, "but I still think Baloo should have warned
thee against them."

"I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey
People! Faugh!"

A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking
Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly
true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look
up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross
each other's path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded
tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks
and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then
they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People
to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles
over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the
Jungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a
leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because
their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they
compromised things by making up a saying, "What the Bandar-log think now
the jungle will think later," and that comforted them a great deal. None
of the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts
would notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli
came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.

They never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at
all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea, and
he told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in
the tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection from
the wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him teach them.
Of course Mowgli, as a woodcutter's child, inherited all sorts of
instincts, and used to make little huts of fallen branches without
thinking how he came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees,
considered his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were
really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the
jungle--so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore
they followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very
quietly till it was time for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was
very much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,
resolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.

The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and
arms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash of branches in his
face, and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo
woke the jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk
with every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled
away to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting:
"He has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People
admire us for our skill and our cunning." Then they began their flight;
and the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of
the things nobody can describe. They have their regular roads and
crossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy
or a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at
night if necessary. Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under
the arms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a
bound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the
boy's weight held them back. Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he could not
help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down below
frightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing
over nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth. His
escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost
branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop
would fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring
up, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next
tree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green
jungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea,
and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face, and he
and his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and
crashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept
along the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.

For a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew
better than to struggle, and then he began to think. The first thing was
to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys
were going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless
to look down, for he could only see the topsides of the branches, so he
stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing
and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die.
Rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a
few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He
whistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop
and heard him give the Kite call for--"We be of one blood, thou and I."
The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to
the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. "Mark
my trail!" Mowgli shouted. "Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera
of the Council Rock."

"In whose name, Brother?" Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of
course he had heard of him.

"Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!"

The last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but
Rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust,
and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the
treetops as Mowgli's escort whirled along.

"They never go far," he said with a chuckle. "They never do what they
set out to do. Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log. This
time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for
themselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill
more than goats."

So he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited.

Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera
climbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke
beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark.

"Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?" he roared to poor Baloo, who had
set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys. "What
was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him?"

"Haste! O haste! We--we may catch them yet!" Baloo panted.

"At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the
Law--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee
open. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing.
They may drop him if we follow too close."

"Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him already, being tired of
carrying him. Who can trust the Bandar-log? Put dead bats on my head!
Give me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees
that I may be stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most
miserable of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why did I not
warn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now
perhaps I may have knocked the day's lesson out of his mind, and he will
be alone in the jungle without the Master Words."

Baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning.

"At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago," said
Bagheera impatiently. "Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect. What
would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like
Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?"

"What do I care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now."

"Unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or kill him
out of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He is wise and well
taught, and above all he has the eyes that make the Jungle-People
afraid. But (and it is a great evil) he is in the power of the
Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have no fear of any of
our people." Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.

"Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am," said
Baloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, "it is true what Hathi the Wild
Elephant says: `To each his own fear'; and they, the Bandar-log, fear
Kaa the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as they can. He steals the
young monkeys in the night. The whisper of his name makes their wicked
tails cold. Let us go to Kaa."

"What will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and
with most evil eyes," said Bagheera.

"He is very old and very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry," said
Baloo hopefully. "Promise him many goats."

"He sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep
now, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?"
Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.

"Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see
reason." Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the Panther,
and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.

They found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,
admiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in retirement for the
last ten days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting
his big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet
of his body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his lips as he
thought of his dinner to come.

"He has not eaten," said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as
he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket. "Be careful,
Bagheera! He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and
very quick to strike."

Kaa was not a poison snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes
as cowards--but his strength lay in his hug, and when he had once
lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said. "Good
hunting!" cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches. Like all snakes of
his breed Kaa was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at first. Then
he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered.

"Good hunting for us all," he answered. "Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do
here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs food. Is there
any news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty
as a dried well."

"We are hunting," said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry
Kaa. He is too big.

"Give me permission to come with you," said Kaa. "A blow more or less is
nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for
days in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a
young ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they were when I was young.
Rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all."

"Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter," said
Baloo.

"I am a fair length--a fair length," said Kaa with a little pride. "But
for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very
near to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my
slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the
Bandar-log, and they called me most evil names."

"Footless, yellow earth-worm," said Bagheera under his whiskers, as
though he were trying to remember something.

"Sssss! Have they ever called me that?" said Kaa.

"Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we
never noticed them. They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all
thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because (they
are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid of the
he-goat's horns," Bagheera went on sweetly.

Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows
that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing
muscles on either side of Kaa's throat ripple and bulge.

"The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds," he said quietly. "When I
came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops."

"It--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now," said Baloo, but the words
stuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one
of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the
monkeys.

"Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such
hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the
Bandar-log," Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity.

"Indeed," Baloo began, "I am no more than the old and sometimes very
foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera
here--"

"Is Bagheera," said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap,
for he did not believe in being humble. "The trouble is this, Kaa. Those
nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of
whom thou hast perhaps heard."

"I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a
man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki
is full of stories half heard and very badly told."

"But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was," said Baloo. "The
best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall
make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides,
I--we--love him, Kaa."

"Ts! Ts!" said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. "I also have known what
love is. There are tales I could tell that--"

"That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,"
said Bagheera quickly. "Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log
now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone."

"They fear me alone. They have good reason," said Kaa. "Chattering,
foolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys. But a
man-thing in their hands is in no good luck. They grow tired of the nuts
they pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning
to do great things with it, and then they snap it in two. That man-thing
is not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish' was it not?"

"Worm--worm--earth-worm," said Bagheera, "as well as other things which
I cannot now say for shame."

"We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must
help their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?"

"The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe," said Baloo. "We
had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa."

"I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the
Bandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter."

"Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf
Pack!"

Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the
Kite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his
wings. It was near Rann's bedtime, but he had ranged all over the jungle
looking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage.

"What is it?" said Baloo.

"I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He bade me tell you. I
watched. The Bandar-log have taken him beyond the river to the monkey
city--to the Cold Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten nights,
or an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is
my message. Good hunting, all you below!"

"Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann," cried Bagheera. "I will
remember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O
best of kites!"

"It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could
have done no less," and Rann circled up again to his roost.

"He has not forgotten to use his tongue," said Baloo with a chuckle of
pride. "To think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the
birds too while he was being pulled across trees!"

"It was most firmly driven into him," said Bagheera. "But I am proud of
him, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs."

They all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever
went there, because what they called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted
city, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that
men have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not.
Besides, the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live
anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it
except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs
held a little water.

"It is half a night's journey--at full speed," said Bagheera, and Baloo
looked very serious. "I will go as fast as I can," he said anxiously.

"We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the
quick-foot--Kaa and I."

"Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four," said Kaa shortly.
Baloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and so they
left him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the quick
panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the
huge Rock-python held level with him. When they came to a hill stream,
Bagheera gained, because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and
two feet of his neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up
the distance.

"By the Broken Lock that freed me," said Bagheera, when twilight had
fallen, "thou art no slow goer!"

"I am hungry," said Kaa. "Besides, they called me speckled frog."

"Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot."

"All one. Let us go on," and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the
ground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and keeping to
it.

In the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli's
friends at all. They had brought the boy to the Lost City, and were
very much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an
Indian city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed
very wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long ago on a little
hill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the
ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted
hinges. Trees had grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were
tumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of
the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.

A great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the
courtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red and green,
and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king's elephants
used to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees.
From the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that
made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness;
the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where
four roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public
wells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs
sprouting on their sides. The monkeys called the place their city, and
pretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest.
And yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to
use them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the king's council
chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run
in and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old
bricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight
and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the
terraces of the king's garden, where they would shake the rose trees and
the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They explored
all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of
little dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what
they had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling
each other that they were doing as men did. They drank at the tanks and
made the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they
would all rush together in mobs and shout: "There is no one in the
jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the
Bandar-log." Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city
and went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice
them.

Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like
or understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold
Lairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli
would have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about
and sang their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told
his companions that Mowgli's capture marked a new thing in the history
of the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks
and canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked
up some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys
tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began
to pull their friends' tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.

"I wish to eat," said Mowgli. "I am a stranger in this part of the
jungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here."

Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild
pawpaws. But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much
trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and
angry as well as hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the
Strangers' Hunting Call from time to time, but no one answered him, and
Mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed. "All that Baloo
has said about the Bandar-log is true," he thought to himself. "They
have no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish words
and little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here,
it will be all my own fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle.
Baloo will surely beat me, but that is better than chasing silly rose
leaves with the Bandar-log."

No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him
back, telling him that he did not know how happy he was, and pinching
him to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but
went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone
reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined
summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for
queens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and
blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the
queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble
tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians
and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it
shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black
velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not
help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him
how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he
was to wish to leave them. "We are great. We are free. We are wonderful.
We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and
so it must be true," they shouted. "Now as you are a new listener and
can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us
in future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves." Mowgli
made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on
the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the
Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would
all shout together: "This is true; we all say so." Mowgli nodded and
blinked, and said "Yes" when they asked him a question, and his head
spun with the noise. "Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these
people," he said to himself, "and now they have madness. Certainly this
is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud
coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might
try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired."

That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined
ditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how
dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run
any risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and
few in the jungle care for those odds.

"I will go to the west wall," Kaa whispered, "and come down swiftly with
the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon
my back in their hundreds, but--"

"I know it," said Bagheera. "Would that Baloo were here, but we must do
what we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace.
They hold some sort of council there over the boy."

"Good hunting," said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That
happened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed
awhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,
and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheera's light
feet on the terrace. The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost
without a sound and was striking--he knew better than to waste time in
biting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli
in circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage,
and then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him,
a monkey shouted: "There is only one here! Kill him! Kill." A scuffling
mass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over
Bagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up the wall
of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome.
A man-trained boy would have been badly bruised, for the fall was a
good fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and
landed on his feet.

"Stay there," shouted the monkeys, "till we have killed thy friends, and
later we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive."

"We be of one blood, ye and I," said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake's
Call. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him
and gave the Call a second time, to make sure.

"Even ssso! Down hoods all!" said half a dozen low voices (every ruin
in India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old
summerhouse was alive with cobras). "Stand still, Little Brother, for
thy feet may do us harm."

Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and
listening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther--the
yells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera's deep, hoarse cough
as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his
enemies. For the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for
his life.

"Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone," Mowgli
thought. And then he called aloud: "To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the
water tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!"

Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new
courage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the
reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the
jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done
his best, but he could not come before. "Bagheera," he shouted, "I am
here. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my feet! Wait my
coming, O most infamous Bandar-log!" He panted up the terrace only
to disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself
squarely on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as
many as he could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat,
like the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told
Mowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys
could not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just
out of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps,
dancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon him from all sides
if he came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his
dripping chin, and in despair gave the Snake's Call for protection--"We
be of one blood, ye and I"--for he believed that Kaa had turned tail
at the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on
the edge of the terrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black
Panther asking for help.

Kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a
wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch. He had no intention
of losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself
once or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in
working order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the
monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to
and fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even
Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of
the Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their
comrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the
day birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious
to kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of
his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can
imagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half
a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can
roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five
feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and
Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His first stroke was delivered
into the heart of the crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut
mouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys
scattered with cries of--"Kaa! It is Kaa! Run! Run!"

Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories
their elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who could slip along the
branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey
that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead
branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived, till the branch
caught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle,
for none of them knew the limits of his power, none of them could look
him in the face, and none had ever come alive out of his hug. And so
they ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the
houses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief. His fur was much thicker
than Bagheera's, but he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa
opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word, and
the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed
where they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled
under them. The monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped
their cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard
Bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank. Then the
clamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They
clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they
skipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,
put his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his front
teeth, to show his derision and contempt.

"Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more," Bagheera gasped.
"Let us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again."

"They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!" Kaa hissed, and
the city was silent once more. "I could not come before, Brother, but I
think I heard thee call"--this was to Bagheera.

"I--I may have cried out in the battle," Bagheera answered. "Baloo, art
thou hurt?

"I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little
bearlings," said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. "Wow! I
am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I."

"No matter. Where is the manling?"

"Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out," cried Mowgli. The curve of the
broken dome was above his head.

"Take him away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our
young," said the cobras inside.

"Hah!" said Kaa with a chuckle, "he has friends everywhere, this
manling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break
down the wall."

Kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble
tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head
to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear
of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows,
nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and
rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between
Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.

"Art thou hurt?" said Baloo, hugging him softly.

"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled
ye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed."

"Others also," said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the
monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.

"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all
little frogs!" whimpered Baloo.

"Of that we shall judge later," said Bagheera, in a dry voice that
Mowgli did not at all like. "But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle
and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli."

Mowgli turned and saw the great Python's head swaying a foot above his
own.

"So this is the manling," said Kaa. "Very soft is his skin, and he is
not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake
thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat."

"We be one blood, thou and I," Mowgli answered. "I take my life from
thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa."

"All thanks, Little Brother," said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. "And
what may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he
goes abroad."

"I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can
use them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth.
I have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art
in a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to
Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters."

"Well said," growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very
prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli's
shoulder. "A brave heart and a courteous tongue," said he. "They shall
carry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly
with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it
is not well that thou shouldst see."

The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys
huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky
fringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera
began to put his fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the
terrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all
the monkeys' eyes upon him.

"The moon sets," he said. "Is there yet light enough to see?"

From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--"We see, O
Kaa."

"Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still
and watch."

He turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right
to left. Then he began making loops and figures of eight with his
body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided
figures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never
stopping his low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last
the dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle
of the scales.

Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats,
their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.

"Bandar-log," said the voice of Kaa at last, "can ye stir foot or hand
without my order? Speak!"

"Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!"

"Good! Come all one pace nearer to me."

The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and
Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them.

"Nearer!" hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.

Mowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the
two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.

"Keep thy hand on my shoulder," Bagheera whispered. "Keep it there, or I
must go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!"

"It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust," said Mowgli. "Let us
go." And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.

"Whoof!" said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. "Never
more will I make an ally of Kaa," and he shook himself all over.

"He knows more than we," said Bagheera, trembling. "In a little time,
had I stayed, I should have walked down his throat."

"Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again," said Baloo.
"He will have good hunting--after his own fashion."

"But what was the meaning of it all?" said Mowgli, who did not know
anything of a python's powers of fascination. "I saw no more than a big
snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all
sore. Ho! Ho!"

"Mowgli," said Bagheera angrily, "his nose was sore on thy account, as
my ears and sides and paws, and Baloo's neck and shoulders are bitten
on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with
pleasure for many days."

"It is nothing," said Baloo; "we have the man-cub again."

"True, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in
good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and
last of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black
Panther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I
were both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this,
man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log."

"True, it is true," said Mowgli sorrowfully. "I am an evil man-cub, and
my stomach is sad in me."

"Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?"

Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could
not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: "Sorrow never stays punishment.
But remember, Bagheera, he is very little."

"I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now.
Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?"

"Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just."

Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther's point of
view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a
seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could
wish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself
up without a word.

"Now," said Bagheera, "jump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go
home."

One of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores.
There is no nagging afterward.

Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheera's back and slept so deeply that he
never waked when he was put down in the home-cave.




Road-Song of the Bandar-Log

     Here we go in a flung festoon,
     Half-way up to the jealous moon!
     Don't you envy our pranceful bands?
     Don't you wish you had extra hands?
     Wouldn't you like if your tails were--so--
     Curved in the shape of a Cupid's bow?
        Now you're angry, but--never mind,
        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!

     Here we sit in a branchy row,
     Thinking of beautiful things we know;
     Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,
     All complete, in a minute or two--
     Something noble and wise and good,
     Done by merely wishing we could.
        We've forgotten, but--never mind,
        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!

     All the talk we ever have heard
     Uttered by bat or beast or bird--
     Hide or fin or scale or feather--
     Jabber it quickly and all together!
     Excellent!  Wonderful!  Once again!

     Now we are talking just like men!
        Let's pretend we are ... never mind,
        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!
        This is the way of the Monkey-kind.

     Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,
     That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.
     By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,
     Be sure, be sure, we're going to do some splendid things!




"Tiger! Tiger!"

     What of the hunting, hunter bold?
        Brother, the watch was long and cold.
     What of the quarry ye went to kill?
        Brother, he crops in the jungle still.
     Where is the power that made your pride?
        Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side.
     Where is the haste that ye hurry by?
        Brother, I go to my lair--to die.

Now we must go back to the first tale. When Mowgli left the wolf's cave
after the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he went down to the
plowed lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop there
because it was too near to the jungle, and he knew that he had made at
least one bad enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to
the rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady
jog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he came to a country that he
did not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with
rocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at
the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds,
and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the
plain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in
charge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow
pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked
on, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village gate he
saw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight,
pushed to one side.

"Umph!" he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade in
his night rambles after things to eat. "So men are afraid of the People
of the Jungle here also." He sat down by the gate, and when a man came
out he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to show that
he wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the
village shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in
white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. The priest came to
the gate, and with him at least a hundred people, who stared and talked
and shouted and pointed at Mowgli.

"They have no manners, these Men Folk," said Mowgli to himself. "Only
the gray ape would behave as they do." So he threw back his long hair
and frowned at the crowd.

"What is there to be afraid of?" said the priest. "Look at the marks on
his arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child
run away from the jungle."

Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder
than they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and
legs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these
bites, for he knew what real biting meant.

"Arre! Arre!" said two or three women together. "To be bitten by wolves,
poor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire. By my
honor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger."

"Let me look," said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and
ankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. "Indeed he
is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy."

The priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the
richest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a minute
and said solemnly: "What the jungle has taken the jungle has restored.
Take the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the
priest who sees so far into the lives of men."

"By the Bull that bought me," said Mowgli to himself, "but all this
talking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a
man I must become."

The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there
was a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny
raised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a
Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such
as they sell at the country fairs.

She gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her
hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that
he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had
taken him. So she said, "Nathoo, O Nathoo!" Mowgli did not show that he
knew the name. "Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new
shoes?" She touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. "No,"
she said sorrowfully, "those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art
very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son."

Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as
he looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he
wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. "What is the
good of a man," he said to himself at last, "if he does not understand
man's talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the
jungle. I must speak their talk."

It was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to
imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little
wild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate
it almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many
things in the hut.

There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under
anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they
shut the door he went through the window. "Give him his will," said
Messua's husband. "Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed.
If he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away."

So Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of
the field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him
under the chin.

"Phew!" said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf's cubs).
"This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest
of wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little
Brother; I bring news."

"Are all well in the jungle?" said Mowgli, hugging him.

"All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now,
listen. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows
again, for he is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will
lay thy bones in the Waingunga."

"There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But
news is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things,
Gray Brother,--but bring me the news always."

"Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee
forget?" said Gray Brother anxiously.

"Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But
also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack."

"And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,
Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When
I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge
of the grazing-ground."

For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village
gate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had
to wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had
to learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and
about plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children
in the village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had
taught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on
keeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not
play games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the
knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him
from picking them up and breaking them in two.

He did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he
was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that
he was as strong as a bull.

And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes
between man and man. When the potter's donkey slipped in the clay pit,
Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their
journey to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for
the potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest
scolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the
priest told Messua's husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as
soon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would
have to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they
grazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he
had been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off
to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great
fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and
the barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the
village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys
sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the
platform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk
every night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree
and talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into
the night. They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and
Buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the
jungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged
out of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle
was always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their
crops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within
sight of the village gates.

Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of,
had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo,
the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story
to another, and Mowgli's shoulders shook.

Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua's son
was a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked,
old money-lender, who had died some years ago. "And I know that this is
true," he said, "because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he
got in a riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I
speak of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal."

"True, true, that must be the truth," said the gray-beards, nodding
together.

"Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?" said Mowgli. "That
tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the
soul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal
is child's talk."

Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man
stared.

"Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?" said Buldeo. "If thou art so
wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set
a hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders
speak."

Mowgli rose to go. "All the evening I have lain here listening," he
called back over his shoulder, "and, except once or twice, Buldeo has
not said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his very
doors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and
goblins which he says he has seen?"

"It is full time that boy went to herding," said the head-man, while
Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli's impertinence.

The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle
and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back
at night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow
themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that
hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds
they are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But
if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes
carried off. Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting
on the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes,
with their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their
byres, one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to
the children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with
a long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the
cattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be
very careful not to stray away from the herd.

An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little
ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes
generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing
or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge
of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped
from Rama's neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.
"Ah," said Gray Brother, "I have waited here very many days. What is the
meaning of this cattle-herding work?"

"It is an order," said Mowgli. "I am a village herd for a while. What
news of Shere Khan?"

"He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for
thee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to
kill thee."

"Very good," said Mowgli. "So long as he is away do thou or one of the
four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of
the village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak
tree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan's
mouth."

Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while
the buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest
things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move
on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes
very seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after
another, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and
staring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like
logs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children
hear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead,
and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep
down, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and
the next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be
a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and
wake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put
grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight;
or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard
basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they
sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and
the day seems longer than most people's whole lives, and perhaps they
make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and
put reeds into the men's hands, and pretend that they are kings and the
figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then
evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of
the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other,
and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village
lights.

Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and
day after day he would see Gray Brother's back a mile and a half away
across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day
after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him,
and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false
step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would
have heard him in those long, still mornings.

At last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place,
and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree,
which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother,
every bristle on his back lifted.

"He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed the
ranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail," said the Wolf,
panting.

Mowgli frowned. "I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very
cunning."

"Have no fear," said Gray Brother, licking his lips a little. "I met
Tabaqui in the dawn. Now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites, but
he told me everything before I broke his back. Shere Khan's plan is to
wait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee and for no one
else. He is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the Waingunga."

"Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?" said Mowgli, for the answer
meant life and death to him.

"He killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan
could never fast, even for the sake of revenge."

"Oh! Fool, fool! What a cub's cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he
thinks that I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does he lie up?
If there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies. These
buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot speak their
language. Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?"

"He swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off," said Gray Brother.

"Tabaqui told him that, I know. He would never have thought of it
alone." Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth, thinking. "The big
ravine of the Waingunga. That opens out on the plain not half a mile
from here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of
the ravine and then sweep down--but he would slink out at the foot. We
must block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for
me?"

"Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper." Gray Brother trotted
off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that
Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry
of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.

"Akela! Akela!" said Mowgli, clapping his hands. "I might have known
that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the
herd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and
the plow buffaloes by themselves."

The two wolves ran, ladies'-chain fashion, in and out of the herd, which
snorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps. In one,
the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared
and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and
trample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls
snorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much
less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have
divided the herd so neatly.

"What orders!" panted Akela. "They are trying to join again."

Mowgli slipped on to Rama's back. "Drive the bulls away to the left,
Akela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive
them into the foot of the ravine."

"How far?" said Gray Brother, panting and snapping.

"Till the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump," shouted Mowgli.
"Keep them there till we come down." The bulls swept off as Akela bayed,
and Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged down on him,
and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela drove
the bulls far to the left.

"Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful,
now--careful, Akela. A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah!
This is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these
creatures could move so swiftly?" Mowgli called.

"I have--have hunted these too in my time," gasped Akela in the dust.
"Shall I turn them into the jungle?"

"Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only
tell him what I need of him to-day."

The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the
standing thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half
a mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry
them, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.

But Mowgli's plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a
big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the
bulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for
he knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in
any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was
soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the
rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a
long, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and
give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd
at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to
the ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the
trees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides
of the ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they
ran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung
over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.

"Let them breathe, Akela," he said, holding up his hand. "They have not
winded him yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We
have him in the trap."

He put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost
like shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.

After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a
full-fed tiger just wakened.

"Who calls?" said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of
the ravine screeching.

"I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!
Down--hurry them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!"

The herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave
tongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the
other, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up
round them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before
they were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and
bellowed.

"Ha! Ha!" said Mowgli, on his back. "Now thou knowest!" and the torrent
of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the
ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being
shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the
creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible
charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand.
Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and
lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of
escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on,
heavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do anything rather than
fight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing
till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot
of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came
to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their
calves), and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over
something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the
other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet
by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the
plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and
slipped off Rama's neck, laying about him right and left with his stick.

"Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they will be fighting one
another. Drive them away, Akela. Hai, Rama! Hai, hai, hai! my children.
Softly now, softly! It is all over."

Akela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes' legs,
and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli
managed to turn Rama, and the others followed him to the wallows.

Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were
coming for him already.

"Brothers, that was a dog's death," said Mowgli, feeling for the knife
he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men.
"But he would never have shown fight. His hide will look well on the
Council Rock. We must get to work swiftly."

A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot
tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal's
skin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work,
and Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves
lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them.
Presently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with
the Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo
stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct
Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of
sight as soon as they saw the man coming.

"What is this folly?" said Buldeo angrily. "To think that thou canst
skin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger
too, and there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well, well, we will
overlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one
of the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara."
He fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to
singe Shere Khan's whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tiger's
whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them.

"Hum!" said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a
forepaw. "So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and
perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for
my own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!"

"What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the
stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The tiger has
just fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst
not even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo,
must be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one
anna of the reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!"

"By the Bull that bought me," said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the
shoulder, "must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela,
this man plagues me."

Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan's head, found himself
sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli
went on skinning as though he were alone in all India.

"Ye-es," he said, between his teeth. "Thou art altogether right, Buldeo.
Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war
between this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won."

To do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have
taken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf
who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating
tigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind,
thought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would
protect him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see
Mowgli turn into a tiger too.

"Maharaj! Great King," he said at last in a husky whisper.

"Yes," said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little.

"I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a
herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to
pieces?"

"Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my
game. Let him go, Akela."

Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back
over his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible.
When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and
sorcery that made the priest look very grave.

Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and
the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.

"Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd
them, Akela."

The herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the
village Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the temple
blowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him
by the gate. "That is because I have killed Shere Khan," he said
to himself. But a shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the
villagers shouted: "Sorcerer! Wolf's brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get
hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot,
Buldeo, shoot!"

The old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed
in pain.

"More sorcery!" shouted the villagers. "He can turn bullets. Buldeo,
that was thy buffalo."

"Now what is this?" said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker.

"They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine," said Akela,
sitting down composedly. "It is in my head that, if bullets mean
anything, they would cast thee out."

"Wolf! Wolf's cub! Go away!" shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the
sacred tulsi plant.

"Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I
am a wolf. Let us go, Akela."

A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: "Oh, my son,
my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast
at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo
says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo's death."

"Come back, Messua!" shouted the crowd. "Come back, or we will stone
thee."

Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in
the mouth. "Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they tell
under the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son's life.
Farewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly
than their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!"

"Now, once more, Akela," he cried. "Bring the herd in."

The buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly
needed Akela's yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,
scattering the crowd right and left.

"Keep count!" shouted Mowgli scornfully. "It may be that I have stolen
one of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you
well, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my
wolves and hunt you up and down your street."

He turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he
looked up at the stars he felt happy. "No more sleeping in traps for me,
Akela. Let us get Shere Khan's skin and go away. No, we will not hurt
the village, for Messua was kind to me."

When the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the
horrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a
bundle on his head, trotting across at the steady wolf's trot that eats
up the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew
the conches louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered
the story of his adventures in the jungle, till he ended by saying that
Akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man.

The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the
hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf's cave.

"They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother," shouted Mowgli, "but
I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word."

Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and
her eyes glowed as she saw the skin.

"I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into
this cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter
would be the hunted. It is well done."

"Little Brother, it is well done," said a deep voice in the thicket.
"We were lonely in the jungle without thee," and Bagheera came running
to Mowgli's bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and
Mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit,
and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon
it, and called the old call to the Council, "Look--look well, O Wolves,"
exactly as he had called when Mowgli was first brought there.

Ever since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader,
hunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered the call
from habit; and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen
into, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating
bad food, and many were missing. But they came to the Council Rock, all
that were left of them, and saw Shere Khan's striped hide on the rock,
and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet. It
was then that Mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all
by itself, and he shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling
skin, and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left,
while Gray Brother and Akela howled between the verses.

"Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept my word?" said Mowgli. And the wolves
bayed "Yes," and one tattered wolf howled:

"Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of
this lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more."

"Nay," purred Bagheera, "that may not be. When ye are full-fed, the
madness may come upon you again. Not for nothing are ye called the Free
People. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves."

"Man-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out," said Mowgli. "Now I will hunt
alone in the jungle."

"And we will hunt with thee," said the four cubs.

So Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from
that day on. But he was not always alone, because, years afterward, he
became a man and married.

But that is a story for grown-ups.




Mowgli's Song

     THAT HE SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE
     DANCED ON SHERE KHAN'S HIDE

     The Song of Mowgli--I, Mowgli, am singing.  Let the jungle
        listen to the things I have done.

     Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill!  At the gates in the
        twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!

     He ate and he drank.  Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou
        drink again?  Sleep and dream of the kill.

     I am alone on the grazing-grounds.  Gray Brother, come to me!
        Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!

     Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls
        with the angry eyes.  Drive them to and fro as I order.

     Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan?  Wake, oh, wake!  Here come I,
        and the bulls are behind.

     Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot.  Waters of
        the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan?

     He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should
        fly.  He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches.  Little
        bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?

     Ow!  He is there.  Ahoo!  He is there.  Under the feet of Rama
        lies the Lame One!  Up, Shere Khan!

     Up and kill!  Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!

     Hsh!  He is asleep.  We will not wake him, for his strength is
        very great.  The kites have come down to see it.  The black
        ants have come up to know it.  There is a great assembly in his
        honor.

     Alala!  I have no cloth to wrap me.  The kites will see that I am
        naked.  I am ashamed to meet all these people.

     Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan.  Lend me thy gay striped coat that I
        may go to the Council Rock.

     By the Bull that bought me I made a promise--a little promise.
        Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.

     With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the
        hunter, I will stoop down for my gift.

     Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his coat for the love
        that he bears me.  Pull, Gray Brother!  Pull, Akela!  Heavy is
        the hide of Shere Khan.

     The Man Pack are angry.  They throw stones and talk child's talk.
        My mouth is bleeding.  Let me run away.

     Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my
        brothers.  We will leave the lights of the village and go to
        the low moon.

     Waters of the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out.  I did
        them no harm, but they were afraid of me.  Why?

     Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and
        the village gates are shut.  Why?

     As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the
        village and the jungle.  Why?

     I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My
        mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but
        my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.
        Why?

     These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the
        spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it
        falls.  Why?

     I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.

     All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.  Look--look
        well, O Wolves!

     Ahae!  My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand.




The White Seal

     Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,
        And black are the waters that sparkled so green.
     The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us
        At rest in the hollows that rustle between.
     Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow,
        Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!
     The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,
        Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas!

                                              Seal Lullaby


All these things happened several years ago at a place called
Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and
away in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale
when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I
took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days
till he was fit to fly back to St. Paul's again. Limmershin is a very
quaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth.

Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people
who have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer
months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea.
For Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any
place in all the world.

Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place
he happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for
Novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good
place on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was
fifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his
shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved himself up on his
front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his
weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven
hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights,
but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head
on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face;
then he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were
firmly fixed on the other seal's neck, the other seal might get away if
he could, but Sea Catch would not help him.

Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules
of the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as
there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same
thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the
beach was something frightful.

From a little hill called Hutchinson's Hill, you could look over three
and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was
dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their
share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the
sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries,
for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives
never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they
did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and
four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about
half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the
sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green
thing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and
there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah
alone.

Sea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when
Matkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea,
and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his
reservation, saying gruffly: "Late as usual. Where have you been?"

It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four
months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad.
Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: "How
thoughtful of you. You've taken the old place again."

"I should think I had," said Sea Catch. "Look at me!"

He was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out,
and his sides were torn to ribbons.

"Oh, you men, you men!" Matkah said, fanning herself with her hind
flipper. "Why can't you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You
look as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale."

"I haven't been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The
beach is disgracefully crowded this season. I've met at least a hundred
seals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why can't people stay where
they belong?"

"I've often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter
Island instead of this crowded place," said Matkah.

"Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they
would say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear."

Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended
to go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a
sharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were
on the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the
loudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals
on the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie,
fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going
down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying
over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing
about in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at
Novastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look
all pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.

Kotick, Matkah's baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he
was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals
must be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother
look at him very closely.

"Sea Catch," she said, at last, "our baby's going to be white!"

"Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!" snorted Sea Catch. "There never has
been such a thing in the world as a white seal."

"I can't help that," said Matkah; "there's going to be now." And she
sang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their
babies:

     You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old,
        Or your head will be sunk by your heels;
     And summer gales and Killer Whales
        Are bad for baby seals.

     Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,
        As bad as bad can be;
     But splash and grow strong,
     And you can't be wrong.
        Child of the Open Sea!

Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He
paddled and scrambled about by his mother's side, and learned to scuffle
out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the
two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go
to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days,
but then he ate all he could and throve upon it.

The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens
of thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like
puppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old
people in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie
kept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.

When Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight
to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until
she heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight
lines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking
the youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few
hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and
the babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, "So long as you
don't lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut
or scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy
sea, nothing will hurt you here."

Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy
till they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave
carried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little
hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song,
and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have
drowned.

After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the
waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always
kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks
learning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and
out of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and
took catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found
that he truly belonged to the water.

Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking
under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a
swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or
standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did;
or playing "I'm the King of the Castle" on slippery, weedy rocks that
just stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like
a big shark's fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that
was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get
them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin
would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.

Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul's for the deep sea, by
families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,
and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. "Next year," said
Matkah to Kotick, "you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must
learn how to catch fish."

They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how
to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his
little nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the
long, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all
over, Matkah told him he was learning the "feel of the water," and that
tingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard
and get away.

"In a little time," she said, "you'll know where to swim to, but just
now we'll follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he is very wise." A school
of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little
Kotick followed them as fast as he could. "How do you know where to go
to?" he panted. The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked
under. "My tail tingles, youngster," he said. "That means there's a gale
behind me. Come along! When you're south of the Sticky Water [he meant
the Equator] and your tail tingles, that means there's a gale in front
of you and you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here."

This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always
learning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the
under-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds;
how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart
like a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes
ran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing
all over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed
Albatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to
jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers
close to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone
because they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at
full speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a
ship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick
did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all
that time he never set flipper on dry ground.

One day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water
somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all
over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he
remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles
away, the games his companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the
seal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming
steadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for
the same place, and they said: "Greeting, Kotick! This year we are
all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off
Lukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?"

Kotick's fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of
it, he only said, "Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land." And
so they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the
old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.

That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea
is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to
Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a
flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent
streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds
and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what
they had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific
as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if
anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart
of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie
romped down from Hutchinson's Hill crying: "Out of the way, youngsters!
The sea is deep and you don't know all that's in it yet. Wait till
you've rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white
coat?"

"I didn't get it," said Kotick. "It grew." And just as he was going to
roll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces
came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man
before, coughed and lowered his head. The holluschickie just bundled off
a few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick
Booterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon,
his son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea
nurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the
killing pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned
into seal-skin jackets later on.

"Ho!" said Patalamon. "Look! There's a white seal!"

Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was
an Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a
prayer. "Don't touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal
since--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof's ghost. He was lost
last year in the big gale."

"I'm not going near him," said Patalamon. "He's unlucky. Do you really
think he is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him for some gulls' eggs."

"Don't look at him," said Kerick. "Head off that drove of
four-year-olds. The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it's the
beginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do.
Quick!"

Patalamon rattled a pair of seal's shoulder bones in front of a herd
of holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he
stepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland,
and they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went
on playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions,
and none of his companions could tell him anything, except that the
men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every
year.

"I am going to follow," he said, and his eyes nearly popped out of his
head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd.

"The white seal is coming after us," cried Patalamon. "That's the first
time a seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone."

"Hsh! Don't look behind you," said Kerick. "It is Zaharrof's ghost! I
must speak to the priest about this."

The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an
hour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they
would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they
were skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion's Neck, past
Webster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight
of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering.
He thought that he was at the world's end, but the roar of the seal
nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel.
Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch
and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the
fog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each
with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick
pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions
or too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made
of the skin of a walrus's throat, and then Kerick said, "Let go!" and
then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.

Ten minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more,
for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers,
whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough
for Kotick. He turned and galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for
a short time) back to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with
horror. At Sea Lion's Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge
of the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and
rocked there, gasping miserably. "What's here?" said a sea lion gruffly,
for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.

"Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!" ("I'm lonesome, very lonesome!") said
Kotick. "They're killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!"

The Sea Lion turned his head inshore. "Nonsense!" he said. "Your
friends are making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick
polishing off a drove. He's done that for thirty years."

"It's horrible," said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and
steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him
all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.

"Well done for a yearling!" said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good
swimming. "I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it,
but if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get
to know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come
you will always be driven."

"Isn't there any such island?" began Kotick.

"I've followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I can't
say I've found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a fondness for
talking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to
Sea Vitch. He may know something. Don't flounce off like that. It's a
six-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first,
little one."

Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own
beach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as
seals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet
of rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and
rock and gulls' nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.

He landed close to old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled,
fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners
except when he is asleep--as he was then, with his hind flippers half in
and half out of the surf.

"Wake up!" barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.

"Hah! Ho! Hmph! What's that?" said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next
walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the
next, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction
but the right one.

"Hi! It's me," said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a
little white slug.

"Well! May I be--skinned!" said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick
as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a
little boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just
then; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: "Isn't there any place
for seals to go where men don't ever come?"

"Go and find out," said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. "Run away. We're
busy here."

Kotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could:
"Clam-eater! Clam-eater!" He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in
his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to
be a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies
and the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the
Puffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the
cry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not
have heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling
and screaming "Clam-eater! Stareek [old man]!" while Sea Vitch rolled
from side to side grunting and coughing.

"Now will you tell?" said Kotick, all out of breath.

"Go and ask Sea Cow," said Sea Vitch. "If he is living still, he'll be
able to tell you."

"How shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him?" said Kotick, sheering off.

"He's the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch," screamed a
Burgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch's nose. "Uglier, and with
worse manners! Stareek!"

Kotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he
found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover
a quiet place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven
the holluschickie--it was part of the day's work--and that if he did not
like to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds.
But none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the
difference between him and his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white
seal.

"What you must do," said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his son's
adventures, "is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have
a nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another
five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself." Even gentle
Matkah, his mother, said: "You will never be able to stop the killing.
Go and play in the sea, Kotick." And Kotick went off and danced the
Fire-dance with a very heavy little heart.

That autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone
because of a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow,
if there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet
island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not
get at them. So he explored and explored by himself from the North to
the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day
and a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly
escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and
the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up
and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted
scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow
very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island
that he could fancy.

If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play
on, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down
blubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that
seals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew
that where men had come once they would come again.

He picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that
Kerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick
went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked
black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as
he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once
been a seal nursery. And it was so in all the other islands that he
visited.

Limmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five
seasons exploring, with a four months' rest each year at Novastoshnah,
when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary
islands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator,
where he was nearly baked to death; he went to the Georgia Islands,
the Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough's Island,
Bouvet's Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island
south of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the People of the Sea
told him the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a
time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of
miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that
was when he was coming back from Gough's Island), he found a few hundred
mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.

That nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his
own beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of
green trees, where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick
caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows. "Now," said Kotick,
"I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens
with the holluschickie I shall not care."

The old seal said, "Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of
Masafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand
there was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come
out of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old,
and I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more."

And Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, "I am the
only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the
only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands."

This cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that
summer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for
he was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly
white mane on his shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his
father. "Give me another season," he said. "Remember, Mother, it is
always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach."

Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put
off marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with
her all down Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last
exploration. This time he went westward, because he had fallen on the
trail of a great shoal of halibut, and he needed at least one hundred
pounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition. He chased them till
he was tired, and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the
hollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the
coast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently
bumped on a weed-bed, he said, "Hm, tide's running strong tonight," and
turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched. Then
he jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal
water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.

"By the Great Combers of Magellan!" he said, beneath his mustache. "Who
in the Deep Sea are these people?"

They were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish,
squid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between
twenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a
shovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet
leather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw,
and they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they
weren't grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front
flippers as a fat man waves his arm.

"Ahem!" said Kotick. "Good sport, gentlemen?" The big things answered by
bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began
feeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces
that they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with
a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into
their mouths and chumped solemnly.

"Messy style of feeding, that," said Kotick. They bowed again, and
Kotick began to lose his temper. "Very good," he said. "If you do happen
to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn't show off so. I
see you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names." The split
lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did
not speak.

"Well!" said Kotick. "You're the only people I've ever met uglier than
Sea Vitch--and with worse manners."

Then he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed
to him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled
backward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.

The sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed,
and Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked
up in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as
human beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot
talk. He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven,
and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even
to his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his
foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what
answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.

By daylight Kotick's mane was standing on end and his temper was gone
where the dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very
slowly, stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and
Kotick followed them, saying to himself, "People who are such idiots as
these are would have been killed long ago if they hadn't found out some
safe island. And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for
the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they'd hurry."

It was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or
fifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the
shore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and
under them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went
farther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick
nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were
following up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more.

One night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for
the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick
followed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow
was anything of a swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff
that ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the
foot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and
Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they
led him through.

"My wig!" he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at
the farther end. "It was a long dive, but it was worth it."

The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of
the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long
stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make
seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland
behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long
grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all,
Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea
catch, that no men had ever come there.

The first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good,
and then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low
sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the
northward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that
would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between
the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to
the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth
of the tunnel.

"It's Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better," said Kotick. "Sea
Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men can't come down the cliffs, even
if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to
splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it."

He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was
in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new
country, so that he would be able to answer all questions.

Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced
through to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have
dreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the
cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them.

He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when
he hauled out just above Sea Lion's Neck the first person he met was the
seal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes
that he had found his island at last.

But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals
laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young
seal about his own age said, "This is all very well, Kotick, but you
can't come from no one knows where and order us off like this. Remember
we've been fighting for our nurseries, and that's a thing you never did.
You preferred prowling about in the sea."

The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his
head from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a
great fuss about it.

"I've no nursery to fight for," said Kotick. "I only want to show you
all a place where you will be safe. What's the use of fighting?"

"Oh, if you're trying to back out, of course I've no more to say," said
the young seal with an ugly chuckle.

"Will you come with me if I win?" said Kotick. And a green light came
into his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.

"Very good," said the young seal carelessly. "If you win, I'll come."

He had no time to change his mind, for Kotick's head was out and his
teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal's neck. Then he threw
himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook
him, and knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: "I've done
my best for you these five seasons past. I've found you the island where
you'll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks
you won't believe. I'm going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!"

Limmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin sees ten
thousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his little life
did he see anything like Kotick's charge into the nurseries. He flung
himself at the biggest sea catch he could find, caught him by the
throat, choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for
mercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick
had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and
his deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best
of all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane stood up with
rage, and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was
splendid to look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past,
hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut,
and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave
a roar and shouted: "He may be a fool, but he is the best fighter on the
beaches! Don't tackle your father, my son! He's with you!"

Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache
on end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was
going to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was
a gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that
dared lift up his head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up
and down the beach side by side, bellowing.

At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through
the fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered
nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. "Now," he said, "I've taught
you your lesson."

"My wig!" said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was
fearfully mauled. "The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up
worse. Son, I'm proud of you, and what's more, I'll come with you to
your island--if there is such a place."

"Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow's
tunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again," roared Kotick.

There was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the
beaches. "We will come," said thousands of tired voices. "We will follow
Kotick, the White Seal."

Then Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes
proudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail.
All the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his
wounds.

A week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old
seals) went away north to the Sea Cow's tunnel, Kotick leading them,
and the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next
spring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick's
seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow's tunnel that
more and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at
once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to
turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went
away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the
quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through,
getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the
holluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.




Lukannon

This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when
they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of
very sad seal National Anthem.

     I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)
     Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;
     I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers' song--
     The Beaches of Lukannon--two million voices strong.

     The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,
     The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,
     The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame--
     The Beaches of Lukannon--before the sealers came!

     I met my mates in the morning (I'll never meet them more!);
     They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.
     And o'er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach
     We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.

     The Beaches of Lukannon--the winter wheat so tall--
     The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!
     The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!
     The Beaches of Lukannon--the home where we were born!

     I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.
     Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;
     Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,
     And still we sing Lukannon--before the sealers came.

     Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!
     And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;
     Ere, empty as the shark's egg the tempest flings ashore,
     The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!




"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"

     At the hole where he went in
     Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.
     Hear what little Red-Eye saith:
     "Nag, come up and dance with death!"

     Eye to eye and head to head,
        (Keep the measure, Nag.)
     This shall end when one is dead;
        (At thy pleasure, Nag.)
     Turn for turn and twist for twist--
        (Run and hide thee, Nag.)
     Hah!  The hooded Death has missed!
        (Woe betide thee, Nag!)

This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought
single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee
cantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the
musk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always
creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real
fighting.

He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but
quite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end
of his restless nose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he
pleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could
fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as
he scuttled through the long grass was: "Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!"

One day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived
with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down
a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and
clung to it till he lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in
the hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a
small boy was saying, "Here's a dead mongoose. Let's have a funeral."

"No," said his mother, "let's take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn't
really dead."

They took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his
finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they
wrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he
opened his eyes and sneezed.

"Now," said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into
the bungalow), "don't frighten him, and we'll see what he'll do."

It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because
he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all
the mongoose family is "Run and find out," and Rikki-tikki was a true
mongoose. He looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to
eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched
himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder.

"Don't be frightened, Teddy," said his father. "That's his way of making
friends."

"Ouch! He's tickling under my chin," said Teddy.

Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy's collar and neck, snuffed at
his ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.

"Good gracious," said Teddy's mother, "and that's a wild creature! I
suppose he's so tame because we've been kind to him."

"All mongooses are like that," said her husband. "If Teddy doesn't pick
him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he'll run in and out of
the house all day long. Let's give him something to eat."

They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it
immensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat
in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then
he felt better.

"There are more things to find out about in this house," he said to
himself, "than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall
certainly stay and find out."

He spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself
in the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and
burned it on the end of the big man's cigar, for he climbed up in the
big man's lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into
Teddy's nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy
went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion,
because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the
night, and find out what made it. Teddy's mother and father came in,
the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on
the pillow. "I don't like that," said Teddy's mother. "He may bite the
child." "He'll do no such thing," said the father. "Teddy's safer with
that little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake
came into the nursery now--"

But Teddy's mother wouldn't think of anything so awful.

Early in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda
riding on Teddy's shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled
egg. He sat on all their laps one after the other, because every
well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day
and have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikki's mother (she used to
live in the general's house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what
to do if ever he came across white men.

Then Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen.
It was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as
summer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of
bamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. "This
is a splendid hunting-ground," he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy
at the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing
here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush.

It was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful
nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges
with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The
nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.

"What is the matter?" asked Rikki-tikki.

"We are very miserable," said Darzee. "One of our babies fell out of the
nest yesterday and Nag ate him."

"H'm!" said Rikki-tikki, "that is very sad--but I am a stranger here.
Who is Nag?"

Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for
from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss--a
horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then
inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag,
the big black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.
When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed
balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind,
and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake's eyes that never
change their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.

"Who is Nag?" said he. "I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon
all our people, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off
Brahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!"

He spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the
spectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part
of a hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute, but it is
impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and
though Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother had fed
him on dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose's business in
life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom
of his cold heart, he was afraid.

"Well," said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, "marks
or no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a
nest?"

Nag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in
the grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden
meant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get
Rikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it
on one side.

"Let us talk," he said. "You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?"

"Behind you! Look behind you!" sang Darzee.

Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up in
the air as high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the head
of Nagaina, Nag's wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he was
talking, to make an end of him. He heard her savage hiss as the stroke
missed. He came down almost across her back, and if he had been an old
mongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back
with one bite; but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke
of the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite long enough, and he
jumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and angry.

"Wicked, wicked Darzee!" said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach
toward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach
of snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.

Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes
grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a
little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But
Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its
stroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do
next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure
that he could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel
path near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for
him.

If you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say
that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten,
he runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true.
The victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of
foot--snake's blow against mongoose's jump--and as no eye can follow the
motion of a snake's head when it strikes, this makes things much more
wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose,
and it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to
escape a blow from behind. It gave him confidence in himself, and when
Teddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.

But just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust,
and a tiny voice said: "Be careful. I am Death!" It was Karait, the
dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his
bite is as dangerous as the cobra's. But he is so small that nobody
thinks of him, and so he does the more harm to people.

Rikki-tikki's eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the
peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family.
It looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can
fly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this
is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more
dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn
so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to the back of the head,
he would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not
know. His eyes were all red, and he rocked back and forth, looking for
a good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and
tried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a
fraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head
followed his heels close.

Teddy shouted to the house: "Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a
snake." And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy's mother. His father
ran out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out
once too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake's back,
dropped his head far between his forelegs, bitten as high up the back
as he could get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and
Rikki-tikki was just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom
of his family at dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a
slow mongoose, and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he
must keep himself thin.

He went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while
Teddy's father beat the dead Karait. "What is the use of that?" thought
Rikki-tikki. "I have settled it all;" and then Teddy's mother picked
him up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved Teddy
from death, and Teddy's father said that he was a providence, and Teddy
looked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the
fuss, which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy's mother might just
as well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was thoroughly
enjoying himself.

That night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the
table, he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things.
But he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be
patted and petted by Teddy's mother, and to sit on Teddy's shoulder, his
eyes would get red from time to time, and he would go off into his long
war cry of "Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!"

Teddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under
his chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon
as Teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house,
and in the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the musk-rat, creeping
around by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He
whimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up his mind to run
into the middle of the room. But he never gets there.

"Don't kill me," said Chuchundra, almost weeping. "Rikki-tikki, don't
kill me!"

"Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?" said Rikki-tikki
scornfully.

"Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes," said Chuchundra, more
sorrowfully than ever. "And how am I to be sure that Nag won't mistake
me for you some dark night?"

"There's not the least danger," said Rikki-tikki. "But Nag is in the
garden, and I know you don't go there."

"My cousin Chua, the rat, told me--" said Chuchundra, and then he
stopped.

"Told you what?"

"H'sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in
the garden."

"I didn't--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I'll bite you!"

Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers.
"I am a very poor man," he sobbed. "I never had spirit enough to run out
into the middle of the room. H'sh! I mustn't tell you anything. Can't
you hear, Rikki-tikki?"

Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he
could just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as
faint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a
snake's scales on brick-work.

"That's Nag or Nagaina," he said to himself, "and he is crawling into
the bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to
Chua."

He stole off to Teddy's bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then
to Teddy's mother's bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall
there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as
Rikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he heard
Nag and Nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight.

"When the house is emptied of people," said Nagaina to her husband, "he
will have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in
quietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first
one to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki
together."

"But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the
people?" said Nag.

"Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any
mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king
and queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the
melon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and
quiet."

"I had not thought of that," said Nag. "I will go, but there is no need
that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man
and his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the
bungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go."

Rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then
Nag's head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body
followed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw
the size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head,
and looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his eyes
glitter.

"Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on
the open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?" said
Rikki-tikki-tavi.

Nag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the
biggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. "That is good," said
the snake. "Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may
have that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he
will not have a stick. I shall wait here till he comes. Nagaina--do you
hear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till daytime."

There was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone
away. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the
bottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an
hour he began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep,
and Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which would be the
best place for a good hold. "If I don't break his back at the first
jump," said Rikki, "he can still fight. And if he fights--O Rikki!" He
looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too
much for him; and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.

"It must be the head"' he said at last; "the head above the hood. And,
when I am once there, I must not let go."

Then he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar,
under the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back
against the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head. This
gave him just one second's purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he
was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the
floor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his eyes were red
and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the
tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and banged against the
tin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter,
for he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his
family, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy,
aching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a
thunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red
fire singed his fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had
fired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood.

Rikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was
dead. But the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said,
"It's the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives
now."

Then Teddy's mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was
left of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy's bedroom and
spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out
whether he really was broken into forty pieces, as he fancied.

When morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings.
"Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five
Nags, and there's no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch.
Goodness! I must go and see Darzee," he said.

Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where
Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice. The news
of Nag's death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the
body on the rubbish-heap.

"Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!" said Rikki-tikki angrily. "Is this
the time to sing?"

"Nag is dead--is dead--is dead!" sang Darzee. "The valiant Rikki-tikki
caught him by the head and held fast. The big man brought the
bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my babies
again."

"All that's true enough. But where's Nagaina?" said Rikki-tikki, looking
carefully round him.

"Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag," Darzee went
on, "and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him up
on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing
about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!" And Darzee filled his throat
and sang.

"If I could get up to your nest, I'd roll your babies out!" said
Rikki-tikki. "You don't know when to do the right thing at the right
time. You're safe enough in your nest there, but it's war for me down
here. Stop singing a minute, Darzee."

"For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki's sake I will stop," said
Darzee. "What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?"

"Where is Nagaina, for the third time?"

"On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is
Rikki-tikki with the white teeth."

"Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?"

"In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes
nearly all day. She hid them there weeks ago."

"And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the
wall, you said?"

"Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?"

"Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly
off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina
chase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went
there now she'd see me."

Darzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more
than one idea at a time in his head. And just because he knew that
Nagaina's children were born in eggs like his own, he didn't think at
first that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible bird,
and she knew that cobra's eggs meant young cobras later on. So she flew
off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue
his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some
ways.

She fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out,
"Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and
broke it." Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.

Nagaina lifted up her head and hissed, "You warned Rikki-tikki when I
would have killed him. Indeed and truly, you've chosen a bad place to
be lame in." And she moved toward Darzee's wife, slipping along over the
dust.

"The boy broke it with a stone!" shrieked Darzee's wife.

"Well! It may be some consolation to you when you're dead to know that I
shall settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the rubbish heap
this morning, but before night the boy in the house will lie very still.
What is the use of running away? I am sure to catch you. Little fool,
look at me!"

Darzee's wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a
snake's eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee's wife
fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and
Nagaina quickened her pace.

Rikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced
for the end of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter
above the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs,
about the size of a bantam's eggs, but with whitish skin instead of
shell.

"I was not a day too soon," he said, for he could see the baby cobras
curled up inside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were hatched
they could each kill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops of the
eggs as fast as he could, taking care to crush the young cobras, and
turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed
any. At last there were only three eggs left, and Rikki-tikki began to
chuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee's wife screaming:

"Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the
veranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!"

Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed
with the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as
he could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were
there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating
anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was
coiled up on the matting by Teddy's chair, within easy striking distance
of Teddy's bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of
triumph.

"Son of the big man that killed Nag," she hissed, "stay still. I am not
ready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I
strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed
my Nag!"

Teddy's eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was
to whisper, "Sit still, Teddy. You mustn't move. Teddy, keep still."

Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, "Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and
fight!"

"All in good time," said she, without moving her eyes. "I will settle my
account with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are
still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a
step nearer I strike."

"Look at your eggs," said Rikki-tikki, "in the melon bed near the wall.
Go and look, Nagaina!"

The big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. "Ah-h!
Give it to me," she said.

Rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were
blood-red. "What price for a snake's egg? For a young cobra? For a
young king cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The ants are
eating all the others down by the melon bed."

Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one
egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy's father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy
by the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups,
safe and out of reach of Nagaina.

"Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!" chuckled Rikki-tikki. "The
boy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last night
in the bathroom." Then he began to jump up and down, all four feet
together, his head close to the floor. "He threw me to and fro, but he
could not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew him in two.
I did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with
me. You shall not be a widow long."

Nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg
lay between Rikki-tikki's paws. "Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me
the last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back," she said,
lowering her hood.

"Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go
to the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his
gun! Fight!"

Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach
of her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself
together and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again
and again and again she struck, and each time her head came with a whack
on the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a
watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her, and
Nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head, so that the rustle of
her tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.

He had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came
nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing
breath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and
flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When
the cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a
horse's neck.

Rikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin
again. She headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as
he was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little
song of triumph. But Darzee's wife was wiser. She flew off her nest
as Nagaina came along, and flapped her wings about Nagaina's head. If
Darzee had helped they might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered
her hood and went on. Still, the instant's delay brought Rikki-tikki up
to her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to
live, his little white teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down
with her--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be,
care to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and
Rikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to
turn and strike at him. He held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to
act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth.

Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,
"It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant
Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground."

So he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the
minute, and just as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered
again, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the
hole leg by leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little
shout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed.
"It is all over," he said. "The widow will never come out again." And
the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him, and began to
troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth.

Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was--slept
and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard
day's work.

"Now," he said, when he awoke, "I will go back to the house. Tell the
Coppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead."

The Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of
a little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always making it
is because he is the town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all
the news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the
path, he heard his "attention" notes like a tiny dinner gong, and
then the steady "Ding-dong-tock! Nag is dead--dong! Nagaina is dead!
Ding-dong-tock!" That set all the birds in the garden singing, and the
frogs croaking, for Nag and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little
birds.

When Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy's mother (she looked very
white still, for she had been fainting) and Teddy's father came out and
almost cried over him; and that night he ate all that was given him till
he could eat no more, and went to bed on Teddy's shoulder, where Teddy's
mother saw him when she came to look late at night.

"He saved our lives and Teddy's life," she said to her husband. "Just
think, he saved all our lives."

Rikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.

"Oh, it's you," said he. "What are you bothering for? All the cobras are
dead. And if they weren't, I'm here."

Rikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he did not grow too
proud, and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth
and jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head
inside the walls.




Darzee's Chant

     (Sung in honor of Rikki-tikki-tavi)

     Singer and tailor am I--
        Doubled the joys that I know--
     Proud of my lilt to the sky,
        Proud of the house that I sew--
     Over and under, so weave I my music--so weave I the house that I
        sew.

     Sing to your fledglings again,
        Mother, oh lift up your head!
     Evil that plagued us is slain,
        Death in the garden lies dead.
     Terror that hid in the roses is impotent--flung on the dung-hill
     and dead!

     Who has delivered us, who?
        Tell me his nest and his name.
     Rikki, the valiant, the true,
        Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,
     Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of
     flame!

     Give him the Thanks of the Birds,
        Bowing with tail feathers spread!
     Praise him with nightingale words--
        Nay, I will praise him instead.
     Hear!  I will sing you the praise of the bottle-tailed Rikki, with
     eyeballs of red!

     (Here Rikki-tikki interrupted, and the rest of the song is
     lost.)




Toomai of the Elephants

     I will remember what I was, I am sick of rope and chain--
        I will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs.
     I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane:
        I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs.

     I will go out until the day, until the morning break--
        Out to the wind's untainted kiss, the water's clean caress;
     I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket stake.
        I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!

Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in
every way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years, and as
he was fully twenty years old when he was caught, that makes him nearly
seventy--a ripe age for an elephant. He remembered pushing, with a big
leather pad on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was
before the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full
strength.

His mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had been caught in the
same drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had
dropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag
knew that that advice was good, for the first time that he saw a shell
burst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the
bayonets pricked him in all his softest places. So, before he was
twenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved
and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of
India. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds' weight of tents, on
the march in Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of
a steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a
mortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India,
and had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had
come back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the
Abyssinian War medal. He had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and
epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid,
ten years later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles
south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein.
There he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was
shirking his fair share of work.

After that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few
score other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to
catch wild elephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly
preserved by the Indian Government. There is one whole department which
does nothing else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and
send them up and down the country as they are needed for work.

Kala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been
cut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them
splitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps
than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When,
after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across
the hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last
stockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together,
jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go
into that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when
the flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances), and,
picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer
him and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other
elephants roped and tied the smaller ones.

There was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise
Black Snake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his
time to the charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk
to be out of harm's way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in
mid-air with a quick sickle cut of his head, that he had invented all by
himself; had knocked him over, and kneeled upon him with his huge knees
till the life went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a
fluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail.

"Yes," said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had
taken him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had
seen him caught, "there is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me.
He has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him, and he will
live to see four."

"He is afraid of me also," said Little Toomai, standing up to his full
height of four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old,
the eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take
his father's place on Kala Nag's neck when he grew up, and would handle
the heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by
his father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.

He knew what he was talking of; for he had been born under Kala Nag's
shadow, had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk, had
taken him down to water as soon as he could walk, and Kala Nag would no
more have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would
have dreamed of killing him on that day when Big Toomai carried the
little brown baby under Kala Nag's tusks, and told him to salute his
master that was to be.

"Yes," said Little Toomai, "he is afraid of me," and he took long
strides up to Kala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up
his feet one after the other.

"Wah!" said Little Toomai, "thou art a big elephant," and he wagged his
fluffy head, quoting his father. "The Government may pay for elephants,
but they belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will
come some rich rajah, and he will buy thee from the Government, on
account of thy size and thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing
to do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a gold howdah on thy
back, and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides, and walk at the
head of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit on thy neck, O
Kala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us with golden
sticks, crying, `Room for the King's elephant!' That will be good, Kala
Nag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles."

"Umph!" said Big Toomai. "Thou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf.
This running up and down among the hills is not the best Government
service. I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me
brick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie
them to safely, and flat, broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this
come-and-go camping. Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good. There was a
bazaar close by, and only three hours' work a day."

Little Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing.
He very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads,
with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long
hours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in
his pickets.

What Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an
elephant could take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the
wild elephants browsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and
peacock under Kala Nag's feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the
hills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew
where they would camp that night; the steady, cautious drive of the wild
elephants, and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night's
drive, when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a
landslide, found that they could not get out, and flung themselves at
the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and
volleys of blank cartridge.

Even a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as
three boys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the
best. But the really good time came when the driving out began, and the
Keddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of the end of the
world, and men had to make signs to one another, because they could not
hear themselves speak. Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top of
one of the quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown hair flying
loose all over his shoulders, and he looking like a goblin in the
torch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could hear his
high-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting
and crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered
elephants. "Mael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do!
(Give him the tusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!) Maro! Mar! (Hit
him, hit him!) Mind the post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!" he would
shout, and the big fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would
sway to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant catchers would
wipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find time to nod to Little Toomai
wriggling with joy on the top of the posts.

He did more than wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and
slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope,
which had dropped, to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on
the leg of a kicking young calf (calves always give more trouble than
full-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught him in his trunk, and
handed him up to Big Toomai, who slapped him then and there, and put him
back on the post.

Next morning he gave him a scolding and said, "Are not good brick
elephant lines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs
go elephant catching on thy own account, little worthless? Now those
foolish hunters, whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen
Sahib of the matter." Little Toomai was frightened. He did not know much
of white men, but Petersen Sahib was the greatest white man in the world
to him. He was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man who caught
all the elephants for the Government of India, and who knew more about
the ways of elephants than any living man.

"What--what will happen?" said Little Toomai.

"Happen! The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why
should he go hunting these wild devils? He may even require thee to be
an elephant catcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles,
and at last to be trampled to death in the Keddah. It is well that this
nonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is over, and we of the
plains are sent back to our stations. Then we will march on smooth
roads, and forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that thou
shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty Assamese
jungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with him into
the Keddah, but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does not help
to rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere
hunter,--a mahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of
his service. Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden
underfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son!
Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see that there are no
thorns in his feet. Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and
make thee a wild hunter--a follower of elephant's foot tracks, a jungle
bear. Bah! Shame! Go!"

Little Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all
his grievances while he was examining his feet. "No matter," said Little
Toomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nag's huge right ear. "They
have said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and perhaps--and
perhaps--who knows? Hai! That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!"

The next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in
walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of
tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march
to the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things
that had been worn out or lost in the forest.

Petersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been
paying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an
end, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to
pay the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he went back to his
elephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers,
and hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in
the jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that
belonged to Petersen Sahib's permanent force, or leaned against the
trees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who
were going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the
line and ran about.

Big Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and
Machua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his,
"There goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. 'Tis a pity to
send that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains."

Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens
to the most silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He turned
where he was lying all along on Pudmini's back and said, "What is that?
I did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to
rope even a dead elephant."

"This is not a man, but a boy. He went into the Keddah at the last
drive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that
young calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother."

Machua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and
Little Toomai bowed to the earth.

"He throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is
thy name?" said Petersen Sahib.

Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him,
and Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in
his trunk and held him level with Pudmini's forehead, in front of the
great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his
hands, for he was only a child, and except where elephants were
concerned, he was just as bashful as a child could be.

"Oho!" said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, "and why
didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal
green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to
dry?"

"Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons," said Little Toomai,
and all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of
them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys. Little
Toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air, and he wished very much
that he were eight feet underground.

"He is Toomai, my son, Sahib," said Big Toomai, scowling. "He is a very
bad boy, and he will end in a jail, Sahib."

"Of that I have my doubts," said Petersen Sahib. "A boy who can face a
full Keddah at his age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are
four annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under
that great thatch of hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter too." Big
Toomai scowled more than ever. "Remember, though, that Keddahs are not
good for children to play in," Petersen Sahib went on.

"Must I never go there, Sahib?" asked Little Toomai with a big gasp.

"Yes." Petersen Sahib smiled again. "When thou hast seen the elephants
dance. That is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the
elephants dance, and then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs."

There was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among
elephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat
places hidden away in the forests that are called elephants' ball-rooms,
but even these are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the
elephants dance. When a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other
drivers say, "And when didst thou see the elephants dance?"

Kala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again and
went away with his father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his
mother, who was nursing his baby brother, and they all were put up on
Kala Nag's back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled
down the hill path to the plains. It was a very lively march on account
of the new elephants, who gave trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing
or beating every other minute.

Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but
Little Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him,
and given him money, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he
had been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief.

"What did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?" he said, at last,
softly to his mother.

Big Toomai heard him and grunted. "That thou shouldst never be one of
these hill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he meant. Oh, you in
front, what is blocking the way?"

An Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily,
crying: "Bring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good
behavior. Why should Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you
donkeys of the rice fields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and
let him prod with his tusks. By all the Gods of the Hills, these new
elephants are possessed, or else they can smell their companions in the
jungle." Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the
wind out of him, as Big Toomai said, "We have swept the hills of wild
elephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving.
Must I keep order along the whole line?"

"Hear him!" said the other driver. "We have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You
are very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw
the jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the
season. Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I
waste wisdom on a river-turtle?"

"What will they do?" Little Toomai called out.

"Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast
a cool head. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has
swept all the hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets
to-night."

"What talk is this?" said Big Toomai. "For forty years, father and son,
we have tended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about
dances."

"Yes; but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls
of his hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what
comes. As for their dancing, I have seen the place where--Bapree-bap!
How many windings has the Dihang River? Here is another ford, and we
must swim the calves. Stop still, you behind there."

And in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers,
they made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new
elephants. But they lost their tempers long before they got there.

Then the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps
of pickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the
fodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen
Sahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be
extra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the
reason.

Little Toomai attended to Kala Nag's supper, and as evening fell,
wandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom.
When an Indian child's heart is full, he does not run about and make a
noise in an irregular fashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by
himself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he
had not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. But the
sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten
with the flat of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala
Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he
thumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the
great honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone
among the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the
thumping made him happy.

The new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted
from time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting
his small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God
Shiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very
soothing lullaby, and the first verse says:

     Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
     Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
     Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,
     From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.
        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.
     Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all--
     Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
     And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!

Little Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each
verse, till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala
Nag's side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another
as is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was
left standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put
forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the
hills. The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together,
make one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the other,
the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk
of a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than
we imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept
for some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala
Nag was still standing up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned,
rustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against
half the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away
that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the
stillness, the "hoot-toot" of a wild elephant.

All the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and
their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and
drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and
knotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up
his picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag's leg chain and shackled
that elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string
round Kala Nag's leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast. He
knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same
thing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order
by gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking out across the
moonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to
the great folds of the Garo hills.

"Tend to him if he grows restless in the night," said Big Toomai to
Little Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was
just going to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a
little "tang," and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as
silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai
pattered after him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling
under his breath, "Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O Kala Nag!"
The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the
boy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck,
and almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the
forest.

There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the
silence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes
a tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the
sides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would
scrape along his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder
touched it. But between those times he moved absolutely without any
sound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been
smoke. He was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars
in the rifts of the trees, he could not tell in what direction.

Then Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute,
and Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and
furry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist
over the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he
felt that the forest was awake below him--awake and alive and crowded.
A big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupine's quills
rattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems he
heard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as
it digged.

Then the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go
down into the valley--not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes
down a steep bank--in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as
pistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow
points rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a
noise like torn canvas, and the saplings that he heaved away right and
left with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank,
and great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his tusks
as he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway. Then
Little Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging
bough should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back in
the lines again.

The grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag's feet sucked and squelched
as he put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley
chilled Little Toomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of
running water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling
his way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round
the elephant's legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some
trumpeting both upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and
all the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows.

"Ai!" he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. "The elephant-folk are
out tonight. It is the dance, then!"

Kala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began
another climb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make
his path. That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where
the bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many
elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little
Toomai looked back, and behind him a great wild tusker with his little
pig's eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the
misty river. Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up,
with trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on
every side of them.

At last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top
of the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an
irregular space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as
Little Toomai could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as
a brick floor. Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their
bark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and
polished in the patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from
the upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great
waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But
within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of
green--nothing but the trampled earth.

The moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants
stood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked,
holding his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he
looked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from
between the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and
he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the
tens, and his head began to swim. Outside the clearing he could hear
them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the
hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks
they moved like ghosts.

There were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and
twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears;
fat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black
calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young
elephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of
them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious
faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred
from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights,
and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their
shoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the
full-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger's claws on his
side.

They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground
in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores
of elephants.

Toomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag's neck nothing
would happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive
a wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the
neck of a tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men
that night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard
the chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen
Sahib's pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling
up the hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from
Petersen Sahib's camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that
he did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too,
must have run away from some camp in the hills about.

At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest,
and Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into
the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants
began to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.

Still lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of
broad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling
eyes. He heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by
accident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing
of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick
and hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud came over the moon, and he
sat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and
gurgling went on just the same. He knew that there were elephants all
round Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him out of the
assembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least there
was torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and
once a trunk came up and touched him on the knee.

Then an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten
terrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain
on the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at
first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and
grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and
brought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as
trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and it
sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from
the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on,
and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up
to his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that
ran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth.
Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward
a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of
juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom
of feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning
somewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag
moved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the
clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two
or three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a
shuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours,
and Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the
night air that the dawn was coming.

The morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills,
and the booming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had
been an order. Before Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head,
before even he had shifted his position, there was not an elephant in
sight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls,
and there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to
show where the others had gone.

Little Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he remembered it,
had grown in the night. More trees stood in the middle of it, but the
undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back.
Little Toomai stared once more. Now he understood the trampling. The
elephants had stamped out more room--had stamped the thick grass and
juicy cane to trash, the trash into slivers, the slivers into tiny
fibers, and the fibers into hard earth.

"Wah!" said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy. "Kala Nag, my
lord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib's camp, or I shall
drop from thy neck."

The third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and
took his own path. He may have belonged to some little native king's
establishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.

Two hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his
elephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and
Pudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled
into the camp. Little Toomai's face was gray and pinched, and his
hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute
Petersen Sahib, and cried faintly: "The dance--the elephant dance! I
have seen it, and--I die!" As Kala Nag sat down, he slid off his neck in
a dead faint.

But, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two
hours he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib's hammock with
Petersen Sahib's shooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk,
a little brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him, and while the
old hairy, scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him,
looking at him as though he were a spirit, he told his tale in short
words, as a child will, and wound up with:

"Now, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the
elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and
they will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that
dance-room. They made more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala
Nag took me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!"

Little Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into
the twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed
the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills.
Petersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he
had only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need
to look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to
scratch with his toe in the packed, rammed earth.

"The child speaks truth," said he. "All this was done last night, and
I have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where
Pudmini's leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too."

They looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the
ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to
fathom.

"Forty years and five," said Machua Appa, "have I followed my lord, the
elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what
this child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we
say?" and he shook his head.

When they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen
Sahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should
have two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and
rice and salt, for he knew that there would be a feast.

Big Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for
his son and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at
them as though he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by
the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants,
and Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant
catchers, the trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all
the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to
the other, and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a
newly killed jungle-cock, to show that he was a forester, initiated and
free of all the jungles.

And at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs
made the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too,
Machua Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua
Appa, Petersen Sahib's other self, who had never seen a made road in
forty years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he had no other name
than Machua Appa,--leaped to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in
the air above his head, and shouted: "Listen, my brothers. Listen, too,
you my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This
little one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the
Elephants, as his great-grandfather was called before him. What never
man has seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the
elephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him. He shall
become a great tracker. He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua
Appa! He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed
trail, with a clear eye! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he
runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he slips
before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant
shall know who he is and shall not crush him. Aihai! my lords in the
chains,"--he whirled up the line of pickets--"here is the little one
that has seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never
man saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. Make your
salute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi
Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,--thou hast seen him at the dance, and
thou too, Kala Nag, my pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together! To Toomai
of the Elephants. Barrao!"

And at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the
tips touched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the
crashing trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut
of the Keddah.

But it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never
man had seen before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in
the heart of the Garo hills!




Shiv and the Grasshopper

     (The song that Toomai's mother sang to the baby)

     Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
     Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
     Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,
     From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.
        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.
        Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,--
        Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
        And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!


     Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,
     Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;
     Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,
     And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.
     Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low--
     Parbati beside him watched them come and go;
     Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest--
     Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.
        So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver.
        Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  Turn and see.
        Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,
        But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!

     When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,
     "Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?"
     Laughing, Shiv made answer, "All have had their part,
     Even he, the little one, hidden 'neath thy heart."
     From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,
     Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!
     Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,
     Who hath surely given meat to all that live.
        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.
        Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,--
        Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
        And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!




Her Majesty's Servants

     You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,
     But the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.
     You can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,
     But the way of Pilly Winky's not the way of Winkie Pop!

It had been raining heavily for one whole month--raining on a camp
of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses,
bullocks, and mules all gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi,
to be reviewed by the Viceroy of India. He was receiving a visit from
the Amir of Afghanistan--a wild king of a very wild country. The Amir
had brought with him for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who
had never seen a camp or a locomotive before in their lives--savage
men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every
night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and
stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or the camels
would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents,
and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep.
My tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe.
But one night a man popped his head in and shouted, "Get out, quick!
They're coming! My tent's gone!"

I knew who "they" were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled
out into the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the
other side; and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling,
and I saw the tent cave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance
about like a mad ghost. A camel had blundered into it, and wet and angry
as I was, I could not help laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not
know how many camels might have got loose, and before long I was out of
sight of the camp, plowing my way through the mud.

At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was
somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at
night. As I did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and
the dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and made a
sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that I found, and lay along the
tail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I might
be.

Just as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness
and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to
a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings
and chains and things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little
cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes
to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find
a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.

Behind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching
and slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a
strayed hen's. Luckily, I knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast
language, but camp-beast language, of course--from the natives to know
what he was saying.

He must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to
the mule, "What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white
thing that waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck." (That was
my broken tent pole, and I was very glad to know it.) "Shall we run on?"

"Oh, it was you," said the mule, "you and your friends, that have
been disturbing the camp? All right. You'll be beaten for this in the
morning. But I may as well give you something on account now."

I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel
two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum. "Another time," he said,
"you'll know better than to run through a mule battery at night,
shouting `Thieves and fire!' Sit down, and keep your silly neck quiet."

The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down
whimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big
troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped
a gun tail, and landed close to the mule.

"It's disgraceful," he said, blowing out his nostrils. "Those camels
have racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. How's a
horse to keep his condition if he isn't allowed to sleep. Who's here?"

"I'm the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw
Battery," said the mule, "and the other's one of your friends. He's
waked me up too. Who are you?"

"Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffe's horse. Stand
over a little, there."

"Oh, beg your pardon," said the mule. "It's too dark to see much. Aren't
these camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get
a little peace and quiet here."

"My lords," said the camel humbly, "we dreamed bad dreams in the night,
and we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th
Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords."

"Then why didn't you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native
Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?" said the mule.

"They were such very bad dreams," said the camel. "I am sorry. Listen!
What is that? Shall we run on again?"

"Sit down," said the mule, "or you'll snap your long stick-legs between
the guns." He cocked one ear and listened. "Bullocks!" he said. "Gun
bullocks. On my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very
thoroughly. It takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock."

I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky
white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won't
go any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost
stepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for
"Billy."

"That's one of our recruits," said the old mule to the troop horse.
"He's calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never
hurt anybody yet."

The gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the
young mule huddled close to Billy.

"Things!" he said. "Fearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our
lines while we were asleep. D'you think they'll kill us?"

"I've a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking," said Billy.
"The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the
battery before this gentleman!"

"Gently, gently!" said the troop-horse. "Remember they are always like
this to begin with. The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia
when I was a three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if I'd seen a
camel, I should have been running still."

Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from
Australia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.

"True enough," said Billy. "Stop shaking, youngster. The first time
they put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on
my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off. I hadn't learned the real
science of kicking then, but the battery said they had never seen
anything like it."

"But this wasn't harness or anything that jingled," said the young mule.
"You know I don't mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and
they fell up and down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and
I couldn't find my driver, and I couldn't find you, Billy, so I ran off
with--with these gentlemen."

"H'm!" said Billy. "As soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away
on my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks
gentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the
ground there?"

The gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: "The
seventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We were asleep
when the camels came, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked
away. It is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good
bedding. We told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid
of, but he knew so much that he thought otherwise. Wah!"

They went on chewing.

"That comes of being afraid," said Billy. "You get laughed at by
gun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young un."

The young mule's teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not
being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks
only clicked their horns together and went on chewing.

"Now, don't be angry after you've been afraid. That's the worst kind
of cowardice," said the troop-horse. "Anybody can be forgiven for being
scared in the night, I think, if they see things they don't understand.
We've broken out of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty
of us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at
home in Australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our
head-ropes."

"That's all very well in camp," said Billy. "I'm not above stampeding
myself, for the fun of the thing, when I haven't been out for a day or
two. But what do you do on active service?"

"Oh, that's quite another set of new shoes," said the troop horse. "Dick
Cunliffe's on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have
to do is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs
well under me, and be bridle-wise."

"What's bridle-wise?" said the young mule.

"By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks," snorted the troop-horse, "do you
mean to say that you aren't taught to be bridle-wise in your business?
How can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the
rein is pressed on your neck? It means life or death to your man, and of
course that's life and death to you. Get round with your hind legs under
you the instant you feel the rein on your neck. If you haven't room to
swing round, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs. That's
being bridle-wise."

"We aren't taught that way," said Billy the mule stiffly. "We're taught
to obey the man at our head: step off when he says so, and step in when
he says so. I suppose it comes to the same thing. Now, with all this
fine fancy business and rearing, which must be very bad for your hocks,
what do you do?"

"That depends," said the troop-horse. "Generally I have to go in among a
lot of yelling, hairy men with knives--long shiny knives, worse than
the farrier's knives--and I have to take care that Dick's boot is just
touching the next man's boot without crushing it. I can see Dick's lance
to the right of my right eye, and I know I'm safe. I shouldn't care to
be the man or horse that stood up to Dick and me when we're in a hurry."

"Don't the knives hurt?" said the young mule.

"Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn't Dick's
fault--"

"A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!" said the
young mule.

"You must," said the troop horse. "If you don't trust your man, you may
as well run away at once. That's what some of our horses do, and I don't
blame them. As I was saying, it wasn't Dick's fault. The man was lying
on the ground, and I stretched myself not to tread on him, and he
slashed up at me. Next time I have to go over a man lying down I shall
step on him--hard."

"H'm!" said Billy. "It sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things
at any time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a
well-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and
creep and crawl and wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet
above anyone else on a ledge where there's just room enough for your
hoofs. Then you stand still and keep quiet--never ask a man to hold your
head, young un--keep quiet while the guns are being put together, and
then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the tree-tops ever
so far below."

"Don't you ever trip?" said the troop-horse.

"They say that when a mule trips you can split a hen's ear," said Billy.
"Now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but it's
very seldom. I wish I could show you our business. It's beautiful. Why,
it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at. The
science of the thing is never to show up against the sky line, because,
if you do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep
hidden as much as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your
way. I lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing."

"Fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!"
said the troop-horse, thinking hard. "I couldn't stand that. I should
want to charge--with Dick."

"Oh, no, you wouldn't. You know that as soon as the guns are in
position they'll do all the charging. That's scientific and neat. But
knives--pah!"

The baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time
past, anxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him say, as he
cleared his throat, nervously:

"I--I--I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that
running way."

"No. Now you mention it," said Billy, "you don't look as though you were
made for climbing or running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?"

"The proper way," said the camel. "We all sat down--"

"Oh, my crupper and breastplate!" said the troop-horse under his breath.
"Sat down!"

"We sat down--a hundred of us," the camel went on, "in a big square, and
the men piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired
over our backs, the men did, on all sides of the square."

"What sort of men? Any men that came along?" said the troop-horse. "They
teach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across
us, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I'd trust to do that. It tickles
my girths, and, besides, I can't see with my head on the ground."

"What does it matter who fires across you?" said the camel. "There are
plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many
clouds of smoke. I am not frightened then. I sit still and wait."

"And yet," said Billy, "you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at
night. Well, well! Before I'd lie down, not to speak of sitting down,
and let a man fire across me, my heels and his head would have something
to say to each other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?"

There was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his
big head and said, "This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way
of fighting."

"Oh, go on," said Billy. "Please don't mind me. I suppose you fellows
fight standing on your tails?"

"Only one way," said the two together. (They must have been twins.)
"This is that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon
as Two Tails trumpets." ("Two Tails" is camp slang for the elephant.)

"What does Two Tails trumpet for?" said the young mule.

"To show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other
side. Two Tails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all
together--Heya--Hullah! Heeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor
run like calves. We go across the level plain, twenty yoke of us, till
we are unyoked again, and we graze while the big guns talk across the
plain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of the wall fall out, and
the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home."

"Oh! And you choose that time for grazing?" said the young mule.

"That time or any other. Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked
up again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it.
Sometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of
us are killed, and then there is all the more grazing for those that are
left. This is Fate. None the less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is
the proper way to fight. We are brothers from Hapur. Our father was a
sacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken."

"Well, I've certainly learned something tonight," said the troop-horse.
"Do you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you
are being fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?"

"About as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all
over us, or run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff. A
mountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you
pick your own way, and I'm your mule. But--the other things--no!" said
Billy, with a stamp of his foot.

"Of course," said the troop horse, "everyone is not made in the same
way, and I can quite see that your family, on your father's side, would
fail to understand a great many things."

"Never you mind my family on my father's side," said Billy angrily, for
every mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey. "My father
was a Southern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into
rags every horse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!"

Brumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of
Sunol if a car-horse called her a "skate," and you can imagine how the
Australian horse felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.

"See here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass," he said between
his teeth, "I'd have you know that I'm related on my mother's side to
Carbine, winner of the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we aren't
accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed,
pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery. Are you ready?"

"On your hind legs!" squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each
other, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly
voice, called out of the darkness to the right--"Children, what are you
fighting about there? Be quiet."

Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor
mule can bear to listen to an elephant's voice.

"It's Two Tails!" said the troop-horse. "I can't stand him. A tail at
each end isn't fair!"

"My feelings exactly," said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for
company. "We're very alike in some things."

"I suppose we've inherited them from our mothers," said the troop horse.
"It's not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?"

"Yes," said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. "I'm picketed for
the night. I've heard what you fellows have been saying. But don't be
afraid. I'm not coming over."

The bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, "Afraid of Two Tails--what
nonsense!" And the bullocks went on, "We are sorry that you heard, but
it is true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?"

"Well," said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly
like a little boy saying a poem, "I don't quite know whether you'd
understand."

"We don't, but we have to pull the guns," said the bullocks.

"I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think
you are. But it's different with me. My battery captain called me a
Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day."

"That's another way of fighting, I suppose?" said Billy, who was
recovering his spirits.

"You don't know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt
and between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what
will happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can't."

"I can," said the troop-horse. "At least a little bit. I try not to
think about it."

"I can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there's a
great deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to
cure me when I'm sick. All they can do is to stop my driver's pay till I
get well, and I can't trust my driver."

"Ah!" said the troop horse. "That explains it. I can trust Dick."

"You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me
feel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough
to go on in spite of it."

"We do not understand," said the bullocks.

"I know you don't. I'm not talking to you. You don't know what blood
is."

"We do," said the bullocks. "It is red stuff that soaks into the ground
and smells."

The troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.

"Don't talk of it," he said. "I can smell it now, just thinking of it.
It makes me want to run--when I haven't Dick on my back."

"But it is not here," said the camel and the bullocks. "Why are you so
stupid?"

"It's vile stuff," said Billy. "I don't want to run, but I don't want to
talk about it."

"There you are!" said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.

"Surely. Yes, we have been here all night," said the bullocks.

Two Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. "Oh, I'm
not talking to you. You can't see inside your heads."

"No. We see out of our four eyes," said the bullocks. "We see straight
in front of us."

"If I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn't be needed to pull the
big guns at all. If I was like my captain--he can see things inside his
head before the firing begins, and he shakes all over, but he knows too
much to run away--if I was like him I could pull the guns. But if I were
as wise as all that I should never be here. I should be a king in the
forest, as I used to be, sleeping half the day and bathing when I liked.
I haven't had a good bath for a month."

"That's all very fine," said Billy. "But giving a thing a long name
doesn't make it any better."

"H'sh!" said the troop horse. "I think I understand what Two Tails
means."

"You'll understand better in a minute," said Two Tails angrily. "Now you
just explain to me why you don't like this!"

He began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.

"Stop that!" said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could
hear them stamp and shiver. An elephant's trumpeting is always nasty,
especially on a dark night.

"I shan't stop," said Two Tails. "Won't you explain that, please?
Hhrrmph! Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!" Then he stopped suddenly, and I heard
a little whimper in the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last.
She knew as well as I did that if there is one thing in the world the
elephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. So
she stopped to bully Two Tails in his pickets, and yapped round his big
feet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. "Go away, little dog!" he said.
"Don't snuff at my ankles, or I'll kick at you. Good little dog--nice
little doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast! Oh, why doesn't
someone take her away? She'll bite me in a minute."

"Seems to me," said Billy to the troop horse, "that our friend Two Tails
is afraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I've
kicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly."

I whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose,
and told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I
never let her know that I understood beast talk, or she would have
taken all sorts of liberties. So I buttoned her into the breast of my
overcoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped and growled to himself.

"Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!" he said. "It runs in our family.
Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?"

I heard him feeling about with his trunk.

"We all seem to be affected in various ways," he went on, blowing his
nose. "Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted."

"Not alarmed, exactly," said the troop-horse, "but it made me feel as
though I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don't begin again."

"I'm frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad
dreams in the night."

"It is very lucky for us that we haven't all got to fight in the same
way," said the troop-horse.

"What I want to know," said the young mule, who had been quiet for a
long time--"what I want to know is, why we have to fight at all."

"Because we're told to," said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.

"Orders," said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.

"Hukm hai!" (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two
Tails and the bullocks repeated, "Hukm hai!"

"Yes, but who gives the orders?" said the recruit-mule.

"The man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or holds the nose
rope--Or twists your tail," said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel
and the bullocks one after the other.

"But who gives them the orders?"

"Now you want to know too much, young un," said Billy, "and that is one
way of getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your
head and ask no questions."

"He's quite right," said Two Tails. "I can't always obey, because I'm
betwixt and between. But Billy's right. Obey the man next to you who
gives the order, or you'll stop all the battery, besides getting a
thrashing."

The gun-bullocks got up to go. "Morning is coming," they said. "We will
go back to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and
we are not very clever. But still, we are the only people to-night who
have not been afraid. Good-night, you brave people."

Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation,
"Where's that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about."

"Here I am," yapped Vixen, "under the gun tail with my man. You big,
blundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man's very
angry."

"Phew!" said the bullocks. "He must be white!"

"Of course he is," said Vixen. "Do you suppose I'm looked after by a
black bullock-driver?"

"Huah! Ouach! Ugh!" said the bullocks. "Let us get away quickly."

They plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke
on the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.

"Now you have done it," said Billy calmly. "Don't struggle. You're hung
up till daylight. What on earth's the matter?"

The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle
give, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and
nearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.

"You'll break your necks in a minute," said the troop-horse. "What's the
matter with white men? I live with 'em."

"They--eat--us! Pull!" said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a
twang, and they lumbered off together.

I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen.
We eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and of course the
cattle do not like it.

"May I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who'd have thought of two big
lumps like those losing their heads?" said Billy.

"Never mind. I'm going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I
know, have things in their pockets," said the troop-horse.

"I'll leave you, then. I can't say I'm over-fond of 'em myself. Besides,
white men who haven't a place to sleep in are more than likely to be
thieves, and I've a good deal of Government property on my back. Come
along, young un, and we'll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia!
See you on parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try
to control your feelings, won't you? Good-night, Two Tails! If you pass
us on the ground tomorrow, don't trumpet. It spoils our formation."

Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old
campaigner, as the troop-horse's head came nuzzling into my breast, and
I gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog,
told him fibs about the scores of horses that she and I kept.

"I'm coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart," she said. "Where
will you be?"

"On the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my
troop, little lady," he said politely. "Now I must go back to Dick. My
tail's all muddy, and he'll have two hours' hard work dressing me for
parade."

The big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon,
and Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of
Afghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great
diamond star in the center. The first part of the review was all
sunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving
together, and guns all in a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the
cavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of "Bonnie Dundee," and
Vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The second squadron
of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail
like spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one
back, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly
as waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two
other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while
twenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and
they looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy
the mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and his
harness was oiled and polished till it winked. I gave a cheer all by
myself for Billy the mule, but he never looked right or left.

The rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see
what the troops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the
plain, and were spreading out into a line. That line grew and grew and
grew till it was three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing--one
solid wall of men, horses, and guns. Then it came on straight toward the
Viceroy and the Amir, and as it got nearer the ground began to shake,
like the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast.

Unless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect
this steady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they
know it is only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he had not
shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his
eyes began to get bigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his
horse's neck and looked behind him. For a minute it seemed as though he
were going to draw his sword and slash his way out through the English
men and women in the carriages at the back. Then the advance stopped
dead, the ground stood still, the whole line saluted, and thirty bands
began to play all together. That was the end of the review, and the
regiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry band
struck up with--

     The animals went in two by two,
          Hurrah!
     The animals went in two by two,
     The elephant and the battery mul',
     and they all got into the Ark
          For to get out of the rain!

Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had
come down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.

"Now," said he, "in what manner was this wonderful thing done?"

And the officer answered, "An order was given, and they obeyed."

"But are the beasts as wise as the men?" said the chief.

"They obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he
obeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his
lieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and the captain his major,
and the major his colonel, and the colonel his brigadier commanding
three regiments, and the brigadier the general, who obeys the Viceroy,
who is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is done."

"Would it were so in Afghanistan!" said the chief, "for there we obey
only our own wills."

"And for that reason," said the native officer, twirling his mustache,
"your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our
Viceroy."




Parade Song of the Camp Animals

     ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS

     We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,
     The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;
     We bowed our necks to service: they ne'er were loosed again,--
     Make way there--way for the ten-foot teams
           Of the Forty-Pounder train!

     GUN BULLOCKS

     Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,
     And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;
     Then we come into action and tug the guns again--
     Make way there--way for the twenty yoke
           Of the Forty-Pounder train!

     CAVALRY HORSES

     By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes
     Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,
     And it's sweeter than "Stables" or "Water" to me--
     The Cavalry Canter of "Bonnie Dundee"!

     Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,
     And give us good riders and plenty of room,
     And launch us in column of squadron and see
     The way of the war-horse to "Bonnie Dundee"!

     SCREW-GUN MULES

     As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,
     The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;
     For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,
     Oh, it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to
        spare!

     Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road;
     Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load:
     For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,
     Oh, it's our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to
        spare!

     COMMISSARIAT CAMELS

     We haven't a camelty tune of our own
     To help us trollop along,
     But every neck is a hair trombone
     (Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!)
     And this our marching-song:
     Can't!  Don't!  Shan't!  Won't!
     Pass it along the line!
     Somebody's pack has slid from his back,
     Wish it were only mine!
     Somebody's load has tipped off in the road--
     Cheer for a halt and a row!
     Urrr!  Yarrh!  Grr!  Arrh!
     Somebody's catching it now!

     Children of the Camp are we,
     Serving each in his degree;

     See our line across the plain,
     Like a heel-rope bent again,
     Reaching, writhing, rolling far,
     Sweeping all away to war!
     While the men that walk beside,
     Dusty, silent, heavy-eyed,
     Cannot tell why we or they
     March and suffer day by day.
        Children of the Camp are we,

HOW THE WHALE GOT HIS THROAT

IN the sea, once upon a time, O my Best Beloved, there was a Whale, and
he ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the garfish, and the crab and the
dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate and his mate, and the
mackereel and the pickereel, and the really truly twirly-whirly eel. All
the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth--so! Till
at last there was only one small fish left in all the sea, and he was a
small 'Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale's right ear,
so as to be out of harm's way. Then the Whale stood up on his tail and
said, 'I'm hungry.' And the small 'Stute Fish said in a small 'stute
voice, 'Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever tasted Man?'

'No,' said the Whale. 'What is it like?'

'Nice,' said the small 'Stute Fish. 'Nice but nubbly.'

'Then fetch me some,' said the Whale, and he made the sea froth up with
his tail.

'One at a time is enough,' said the 'Stute Fish. 'If you swim to
latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West (that is magic), you will
find, sitting _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the sea, with nothing on
but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must _not_
forget the suspenders, Best Beloved), and a jack-knife, one
ship-wrecked Mariner, who, it is only fair to tell you, is a man of
infinite-resource-and-sagacity.'

So the Whale swam and swam to latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty
West, as fast as he could swim, and _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the
sea, _with_ nothing to wear except a pair of blue canvas breeches, a
pair of suspenders (you must particularly remember the suspenders, Best
Beloved), _and_ a jack-knife, he found one single, solitary shipwrecked
Mariner, trailing his toes in the water. (He had his mummy's leave to
paddle, or else he would never have done it, because he was a man of
infinite-resource-and-sagacity.)

Then the Whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it nearly
touched his tail, and he swallowed the shipwrecked Mariner, and the
raft he was sitting on, and his blue canvas breeches, and the suspenders
(which you _must_ not forget), _and_ the jack-knife--He swallowed them
all down into his warm, dark, inside cup-boards, and then he smacked his
lips--so, and turned round three times on his tail.

But as soon as the Mariner, who was a man of
infinite-resource-and-sagacity, found himself truly inside the Whale's
warm, dark, inside cup-boards, he stumped and he jumped and he thumped
and he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he banged and he
clanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he creeped, and he
prowled and he howled, and he hopped and he dropped, and he cried and he
sighed, and he crawled and he bawled, and he stepped and he lepped, and
he danced hornpipes where he shouldn't, and the Whale felt most unhappy
indeed. (_Have_ you forgotten the suspenders?)

So he said to the 'Stute Fish, 'This man is very nubbly, and besides he
is making me hiccough. What shall I do?'

'Tell him to come out,' said the 'Stute Fish.

So the Whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked Mariner,
'Come out and behave yourself. I've got the hiccoughs.'

'Nay, nay!' said the Mariner. 'Not so, but far otherwise. Take me to my
natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and I'll think about it.'
And he began to dance more than ever.

 'You had better take him home,' said the 'Stute Fish to the Whale.
 'I ought to have warned you that he is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.'

So the Whale swam and swam and swam, with both flippers and his tail,
as hard as he could for the hiccoughs; and at last he saw the Mariner's
natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed half-way
up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide, and said,
'Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and stations on
the _Fitch_burg Road;' and just as he said 'Fitch' the Mariner walked
out of his mouth. But while the Whale had been swimming, the Mariner,
who was indeed a person of infinite-resource-and-sagacity, had taken his
jack-knife and cut up the raft into a little square grating all running
criss-cross, and he had tied it firm with his suspenders (_now_, you
know why you were not to forget the suspenders!), and he dragged that
grating good and tight into the Whale's throat, and there it stuck! Then
he recited the following _Sloka_, which, as you have not heard it, I
will now proceed to relate--

  By means of a grating
  I have stopped your ating.

For the Mariner he was also an Hi-ber-ni-an. And he stepped out on the
shingle, and went home to his mother, who had given him leave to trail
his toes in the water; and he married and lived happily ever afterward.
So did the Whale. But from that day on, the grating in his throat,
which he could neither cough up nor swallow down, prevented him eating
anything except very, very small fish; and that is the reason why whales
nowadays never eat men or boys or little girls.

The small 'Stute Fish went and hid himself in the mud under the
Door-sills of the Equator. He was afraid that the Whale might be angry
with him.

The Sailor took the jack-knife home. He was wearing the blue canvas
breeches when he walked out on the shingle. The suspenders were left
behind, you see, to tie the grating with; and that is the end of _that_
tale.


     WHEN the cabin port-holes are dark and green
       Because of the seas outside;
     When the ship goes _wop_ (with a wiggle between)
     And the steward falls into the soup-tureen,
       And the trunks begin to slide;
     When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,
     And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,
     And you aren't waked or washed or dressed,
     Why, then you will know (if you haven't guessed)
     You're 'Fifty North and Forty West!'




HOW THE CAMEL GOT HIS HUMP

NOW this is the next tale, and it tells how the Camel got his big hump.

In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the
Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he
lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work;
and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and
tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most 'scruciating idle; and when
anybody spoke to him he said 'Humph!' Just 'Humph!' and no more.

Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his
back and a bit in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come out and
trot like the rest of us.'

'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.

Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said,
'Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.'

'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.

Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said,
'Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.'

'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.

At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox
together, and said, 'Three, O Three, I'm very sorry for you (with the
world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can't work,
or he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and
you must work double-time to make up for it.'

That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they
held a palaver, and an _indaba_, and a _punchayet_, and a pow-wow on
the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed _most_
'scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said 'Humph!' and went
away again.

Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling
in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic),
and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.

'Djinn of All Deserts,' said the Horse, 'is it right for any one to be
idle, with the world so new-and-all?'

'Certainly not,' said the Djinn.

'Well,' said the Horse, 'there's a thing in the middle of your Howling
Desert (and he's a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and
he hasn't done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won't trot.'

'Whew!' said the Djinn, whistling, 'that's my Camel, for all the gold in
Arabia! What does he say about it?'

'He says "Humph!"' said the Dog; 'and he won't fetch and carry.'

'Does he say anything else?'

'Only "Humph!"; and he won't plough,' said the Ox.

'Very good,' said the Djinn. 'I'll humph him if you will kindly wait a
minute.'

The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across
the desert, and found the Camel most 'scruciatingly idle, looking at his
own reflection in a pool of water.

'My long and bubbling friend,' said the Djinn, 'what's this I hear of
your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?'

'Humph!' said the Camel.

The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a
Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of
water.

'You've given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on
account of your 'scruciating idleness,' said the Djinn; and he went on
thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.

'Humph!' said the Camel.

'I shouldn't say that again if I were you,' said the Djinn; you might
say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.'

And the Camel said 'Humph!' again; but no sooner had he said it than he
saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a
great big lolloping humph.

'Do you see that?' said the Djinn. 'That's your very own humph that
you've brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is
Thursday, and you've done no work since Monday, when the work began. Now
you are going to work.'

'How can I,' said the Camel, 'with this humph on my back?'

'That's made a-purpose,' said the Djinn, 'all because you missed those
three days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating,
because you can live on your humph; and don't you ever say I never
did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and
behave. Humph yourself!'

And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the
Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call
it 'hump' now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up
with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he
has never yet learned how to behave.


     THE Camel's hump is an ugly lump
       Which well you may see at the Zoo;
     But uglier yet is the hump we get
       From having too little to do.

     Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
     If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,
         We get the hump--
         Cameelious hump--
     The hump that is black and blue!

     We climb out of bed with a frouzly head
       And a snarly-yarly voice.
     We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
       At our bath and our boots and our toys;

     And there ought to be a corner for me
     (And I know there is one for you)
         When we get the hump--
         Cameelious hump--
     The hump that is black and blue!

     The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
       Or frowst with a book by the fire;
     But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
       And dig till you gently perspire;

     And then you will find that the sun and the wind.
     And the Djinn of the Garden too,
         Have lifted the hump--
         The horrible hump--
     The hump that is black and blue!

     I get it as well as you-oo-oo--
     If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo--
         We all get hump--
         Cameelious hump--
     Kiddies and grown-ups too!




HOW THE RHINOCEROS GOT HIS SKIN

ONCE upon a time, on an uninhabited island on the shores of the Red Sea,
there lived a Parsee from whose hat the rays of the sun were reflected
in more-than-oriental splendour. And the Parsee lived by the Red Sea
with nothing but his hat and his knife and a cooking-stove of the kind
that you must particularly never touch. And one day he took flour and
water and currants and plums and sugar and things, and made himself one
cake which was two feet across and three feet thick. It was indeed a
Superior Comestible (that's magic), and he put it on stove because he
was allowed to cook on the stove, and he baked it and he baked it till
it was all done brown and smelt most sentimental. But just as he
was going to eat it there came down to the beach from the Altogether
Uninhabited Interior one Rhinoceros with a horn on his nose, two piggy
eyes, and few manners. In those days the Rhinoceros's skin fitted him
quite tight. There were no wrinkles in it anywhere. He looked exactly
like a Noah's Ark Rhinoceros, but of course much bigger. All the same,
he had no manners then, and he has no manners now, and he never will
have any manners. He said, 'How!' and the Parsee left that cake and
climbed to the top of a palm tree with nothing on but his hat, from
which the rays of the sun were always reflected in more-than-oriental
splendour. And the Rhinoceros upset the oil-stove with his nose, and
the cake rolled on the sand, and he spiked that cake on the horn of his
nose, and he ate it, and he went away, waving his tail, to the desolate
and Exclusively Uninhabited Interior which abuts on the islands of
Mazanderan, Socotra, and Promontories of the Larger Equinox. Then the
Parsee came down from his palm-tree and put the stove on its legs and
recited the following Sloka, which, as you have not heard, I will now
proceed to relate:--

  Them that takes cakes
  Which the Parsee-man bakes
  Makes dreadful mistakes.

And there was a great deal more in that than you would think.

Because, five weeks later, there was a heat wave in the Red Sea, and
everybody took off all the clothes they had. The Parsee took off his
hat; but the Rhinoceros took off his skin and carried it over his
shoulder as he came down to the beach to bathe. In those days it
buttoned underneath with three buttons and looked like a waterproof. He
said nothing whatever about the Parsee's cake, because he had eaten
it all; and he never had any manners, then, since, or henceforward.
He waddled straight into the water and blew bubbles through his nose,
leaving his skin on the beach.

Presently the Parsee came by and found the skin, and he smiled one smile
that ran all round his face two times. Then he danced three times round
the skin and rubbed his hands. Then he went to his camp and filled his
hat with cake-crumbs, for the Parsee never ate anything but cake, and
never swept out his camp. He took that skin, and he shook that skin, and
he scrubbed that skin, and he rubbed that skin just as full of old,
dry, stale, tickly cake-crumbs and some burned currants as ever it could
possibly hold. Then he climbed to the top of his palm-tree and waited
for the Rhinoceros to come out of the water and put it on.

And the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up with the three buttons, and
it tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but that
made it worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled
and rolled, and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse
and worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed
and rubbed himself against it. He rubbed so much and so hard that he
rubbed his skin into a great fold over his shoulders, and another fold
underneath, where the buttons used to be (but he rubbed the buttons
off), and he rubbed some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his
temper, but it didn't make the least difference to the cake-crumbs.
They were inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry
indeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every rhinoceros
has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all on account of the
cake-crumbs inside.

But the Parsee came down from his palm-tree, wearing his hat, from which
the rays of the sun were reflected in more-than-oriental splendour,
packed up his cooking-stove, and went away in the direction of Orotavo,
Amygdala, the Upland Meadows of Anantarivo, and the Marshes of Sonaput.


     THIS Uninhabited Island
       Is off Cape Gardafui,
     By the Beaches of Socotra
       And the Pink Arabian Sea:
     But it's hot--too hot from Suez
       For the likes of you and me
         Ever to go
         In a P. and O.
     And call on the Cake-Parsee!




HOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS

IN the days when everybody started fair, Best Beloved, the Leopard lived
in a place called the High Veldt. 'Member it wasn't the Low Veldt, or
the Bush Veldt, or the Sour Veldt, but the 'sclusively bare, hot, shiny
High Veldt, where there was sand and sandy-coloured rock and 'sclusively
tufts of sandy-yellowish grass. The Giraffe and the Zebra and the Eland
and the Koodoo and the Hartebeest lived there; and they were 'sclusively
sandy-yellow-brownish all over; but the Leopard, he was the 'sclusivest
sandiest-yellowish-brownest of them all--a greyish-yellowish
catty-shaped kind of beast, and he matched the 'sclusively
yellowish-greyish-brownish colour of the High Veldt to one hair. This
was very bad for the Giraffe and the Zebra and the rest of them; for
he would lie down by a 'sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish stone or
clump of grass, and when the Giraffe or the Zebra or the Eland or the
Koodoo or the Bush-Buck or the Bonte-Buck came by he would surprise them
out of their jumpsome lives. He would indeed! And, also, there was an
Ethiopian with bows and arrows (a 'sclusively greyish-brownish-yellowish
man he was then), who lived on the High Veldt with the Leopard; and the
two used to hunt together--the Ethiopian with his bows and arrows, and
the Leopard 'sclusively with his teeth and claws--till the Giraffe and
the Eland and the Koodoo and the Quagga and all the rest of them didn't
know which way to jump, Best Beloved. They didn't indeed!

After a long time--things lived for ever so long in those days--they
learned to avoid anything that looked like a Leopard or an Ethiopian;
and bit by bit--the Giraffe began it, because his legs were the
longest--they went away from the High Veldt. They scuttled for days
and days and days till they came to a great forest, 'sclusively full of
trees and bushes and stripy, speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows, and there
they hid: and after another long time, what with standing half in the
shade and half out of it, and what with the slippery-slidy shadows of
the trees falling on them, the Giraffe grew blotchy, and the Zebra grew
stripy, and the Eland and the Koodoo grew darker, with little wavy grey
lines on their backs like bark on a tree trunk; and so, though you could
hear them and smell them, you could very seldom see them, and then only
when you knew precisely where to look. They had a beautiful time in the
'sclusively speckly-spickly shadows of the forest, while the Leopard and
the Ethiopian ran about over the 'sclusively greyish-yellowish-reddish
High Veldt outside, wondering where all their breakfasts and their
dinners and their teas had gone. At last they were so hungry that they
ate rats and beetles and rock-rabbits, the Leopard and the Ethiopian,
and then they had the Big Tummy-ache, both together; and then they met
Baviaan--the dog-headed, barking Baboon, who is Quite the Wisest Animal
in All South Africa.

Said Leopard to Baviaan (and it was a very hot day), 'Where has all the
game gone?'

And Baviaan winked. He knew.

Said the Ethiopian to Baviaan, 'Can you tell me the present habitat
of the aboriginal Fauna?' (That meant just the same thing, but the
Ethiopian always used long words. He was a grown-up.)

And Baviaan winked. He knew.

Then said Baviaan, 'The game has gone into other spots; and my advice to
you, Leopard, is to go into other spots as soon as you can.'

And the Ethiopian said, 'That is all very fine, but I wish to know
whither the aboriginal Fauna has migrated.'

Then said Baviaan, 'The aboriginal Fauna has joined the aboriginal Flora
because it was high time for a change; and my advice to you, Ethiopian,
is to change as soon as you can.'

That puzzled the Leopard and the Ethiopian, but they set off to look for
the aboriginal Flora, and presently, after ever so many days, they saw
a great, high, tall forest full of tree trunks all 'sclusively speckled
and sprottled and spottled, dotted and splashed and slashed and hatched
and cross-hatched with shadows. (Say that quickly aloud, and you will
see how very shadowy the forest must have been.)

'What is this,' said the Leopard, 'that is so 'sclusively dark, and yet
so full of little pieces of light?'

'I don't know, said the Ethiopian, 'but it ought to be the aboriginal
Flora. I can smell Giraffe, and I can hear Giraffe, but I can't see
Giraffe.'

'That's curious,' said the Leopard. 'I suppose it is because we have
just come in out of the sunshine. I can smell Zebra, and I can hear
Zebra, but I can't see Zebra.'

'Wait a bit, said the Ethiopian. 'It's a long time since we've hunted
'em. Perhaps we've forgotten what they were like.'

'Fiddle!' said the Leopard. 'I remember them perfectly on the High
Veldt, especially their marrow-bones. Giraffe is about seventeen feet
high, of a 'sclusively fulvous golden-yellow from head to heel; and
Zebra is about four and a half feet high, of a'sclusively grey-fawn
colour from head to heel.'

'Umm, said the Ethiopian, looking into the speckly-spickly shadows of
the aboriginal Flora-forest. 'Then they ought to show up in this dark
place like ripe bananas in a smokehouse.'

But they didn't. The Leopard and the Ethiopian hunted all day; and
though they could smell them and hear them, they never saw one of them.

'For goodness' sake,' said the Leopard at tea-time, 'let us wait till it
gets dark. This daylight hunting is a perfect scandal.'

So they waited till dark, and then the Leopard heard something breathing
sniffily in the starlight that fell all stripy through the branches, and
he jumped at the noise, and it smelt like Zebra, and it felt like Zebra,
and when he knocked it down it kicked like Zebra, but he couldn't see
it. So he said, 'Be quiet, O you person without any form. I am going to
sit on your head till morning, because there is something about you that
I don't understand.'

Presently he heard a grunt and a crash and a scramble, and the Ethiopian
called out, 'I've caught a thing that I can't see. It smells like
Giraffe, and it kicks like Giraffe, but it hasn't any form.'

'Don't you trust it,' said the Leopard. 'Sit on its head till the
morning--same as me. They haven't any form--any of 'em.'

So they sat down on them hard till bright morning-time, and then Leopard
said, 'What have you at your end of the table, Brother?'

The Ethiopian scratched his head and said, 'It ought to be 'sclusively a
rich fulvous orange-tawny from head to heel, and it ought to be Giraffe;
but it is covered all over with chestnut blotches. What have you at your
end of the table, Brother?'

And the Leopard scratched his head and said, 'It ought to be 'sclusively
a delicate greyish-fawn, and it ought to be Zebra; but it is covered
all over with black and purple stripes. What in the world have you been
doing to yourself, Zebra? Don't you know that if you were on the High
Veldt I could see you ten miles off? You haven't any form.'

'Yes,' said the Zebra, 'but this isn't the High Veldt. Can't you see?'

'I can now,' said the Leopard. 'But I couldn't all yesterday. How is it
done?'

'Let us up,' said the Zebra, 'and we will show you.

They let the Zebra and the Giraffe get up; and Zebra moved away to some
little thorn-bushes where the sunlight fell all stripy, and Giraffe
moved off to some tallish trees where the shadows fell all blotchy.

'Now watch,' said the Zebra and the Giraffe. 'This is the way it's done.
One--two--three! And where's your breakfast?'

Leopard stared, and Ethiopian stared, but all they could see were stripy
shadows and blotched shadows in the forest, but never a sign of Zebra
and Giraffe. They had just walked off and hidden themselves in the
shadowy forest.

'Hi! Hi!' said the Ethiopian. 'That's a trick worth learning. Take a
lesson by it, Leopard. You show up in this dark place like a bar of soap
in a coal-scuttle.'

'Ho! Ho!' said the Leopard. 'Would it surprise you very much to know
that you show up in this dark place like a mustard-plaster on a sack of
coals?'

'Well, calling names won't catch dinner, said the Ethiopian. 'The long
and the little of it is that we don't match our backgrounds. I'm going
to take Baviaan's advice. He told me I ought to change; and as I've
nothing to change except my skin I'm going to change that.'

'What to?' said the Leopard, tremendously excited.

'To a nice working blackish-brownish colour, with a little purple in
it, and touches of slaty-blue. It will be the very thing for hiding in
hollows and behind trees.'

So he changed his skin then and there, and the Leopard was more excited
than ever; he had never seen a man change his skin before.

'But what about me?' he said, when the Ethiopian had worked his last
little finger into his fine new black skin.

'You take Baviaan's advice too. He told you to go into spots.'

'So I did,' said the Leopard. I went into other spots as fast as I
could. I went into this spot with you, and a lot of good it has done
me.'

'Oh,' said the Ethiopian, 'Baviaan didn't mean spots in South Africa. He
meant spots on your skin.'

'What's the use of that?' said the Leopard.

'Think of Giraffe,' said the Ethiopian. 'Or if you prefer stripes,
think of Zebra. They find their spots and stripes give them per-feet
satisfaction.'

'Umm,' said the Leopard. 'I wouldn't look like Zebra--not for ever so.'

'Well, make up your mind,' said the Ethiopian, 'because I'd hate to
go hunting without you, but I must if you insist on looking like a
sun-flower against a tarred fence.'

'I'll take spots, then,' said the Leopard; 'but don't make 'em too
vulgar-big. I wouldn't look like Giraffe--not for ever so.'

'I'll make 'em with the tips of my fingers,' said the Ethiopian.
'There's plenty of black left on my skin still. Stand over!'

Then the Ethiopian put his five fingers close together (there was plenty
of black left on his new skin still) and pressed them all over the
Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little
black marks, all close together. You can see them on any Leopard's skin
you like, Best Beloved. Sometimes the fingers slipped and the marks got
a little blurred; but if you look closely at any Leopard now you will
see that there are always five spots--off five fat black finger-tips.

'Now you are a beauty!' said the Ethiopian. 'You can lie out on the bare
ground and look like a heap of pebbles. You can lie out on the naked
rocks and look like a piece of pudding-stone. You can lie out on a leafy
branch and look like sunshine sifting through the leaves; and you
can lie right across the centre of a path and look like nothing in
particular. Think of that and purr!'

'But if I'm all this,' said the Leopard, 'why didn't you go spotty too?'

'Oh, plain black's best for a nigger,' said the Ethiopian. 'Now come
along and we'll see if we can't get even with Mr. One-Two-Three Where's
your Breakfast!'

So they went away and lived happily ever afterward, Best Beloved. That
is all.

Oh, now and then you will hear grown-ups say, 'Can the Ethiopian change
his skin or the Leopard his spots?' I don't think even grown-ups would
keep on saying such a silly thing if the Leopard and the Ethiopian
hadn't done it once--do you? But they will never do it again, Best
Beloved. They are quite contented as they are.


   I AM the Most Wise Baviaan, saying in most wise tones,
   'Let us melt into the landscape--just us two by our lones.'
   People have come--in a carriage--calling. But Mummy is there....
   Yes, I can go if you take me--Nurse says she don't care.
   Let's go up to the pig-sties and sit on the farmyard rails!
   Let's say things to the bunnies, and watch 'em skitter their tails!
   Let's--oh, anything, daddy, so long as it's you and me,
   And going truly exploring, and not being in till tea!
   Here's your boots (I've brought 'em), and here's your cap and stick,
   And here's your pipe and tobacco. Oh, come along out of it--quick.




THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD

IN the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no
trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he
could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things
with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's
Child--who was full of 'satiable curtiosity, and that means he asked
ever so many questions. And he lived in Africa, and he filled all Africa
with his 'satiable curtiosities. He asked his tall aunt, the Ostrich,
why her tail-feathers grew just so, and his tall aunt the Ostrich
spanked him with her hard, hard claw. He asked his tall uncle, the
Giraffe, what made his skin spotty, and his tall uncle, the Giraffe,
spanked him with his hard, hard hoof. And still he was full of 'satiable
curtiosity! He asked his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, why her eyes were
red, and his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, spanked him with her broad,
broad hoof; and he asked his hairy uncle, the Baboon, why melons tasted
just so, and his hairy uncle, the Baboon, spanked him with his hairy,
hairy paw. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity! He asked
questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or
touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was
full of 'satiable curtiosity!

One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this
'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never
asked before. He asked, 'What does the Crocodile have for dinner?' Then
everybody said, 'Hush!' in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him
immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.

By and by, when that was finished, he came upon Kolokolo Bird sitting
in the middle of a wait-a-bit thorn-bush, and he said, 'My father has
spanked me, and my mother has spanked me; all my aunts and uncles have
spanked me for my 'satiable curtiosity; and still I want to know what
the Crocodile has for dinner!'

Then Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, 'Go to the banks of the
great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees,
and find out.'

That very next morning, when there was nothing left of the Equinoxes,
because the Precession had preceded according to precedent, this
'satiable Elephant's Child took a hundred pounds of bananas (the little
short red kind), and a hundred pounds of sugar-cane (the long purple
kind), and seventeen melons (the greeny-crackly kind), and said to all
his dear families, 'Goodbye. I am going to the great grey-green, greasy
Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to find out what the
Crocodile has for dinner.' And they all spanked him once more for luck,
though he asked them most politely to stop.

Then he went away, a little warm, but not at all astonished, eating
melons, and throwing the rind about, because he could not pick it up.

He went from Graham's Town to Kimberley, and from Kimberley to Khama's
Country, and from Khama's Country he went east by north, eating melons
all the time, till at last he came to the banks of the great grey-green,
greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, precisely as
Kolokolo Bird had said.

Now you must know and understand, O Best Beloved, that till that very
week, and day, and hour, and minute, this 'satiable Elephant's Child had
never seen a Crocodile, and did not know what one was like. It was all
his 'satiable curtiosity.

The first thing that he found was a Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake curled
round a rock.

''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child most politely, 'but have you seen
such a thing as a Crocodile in these promiscuous parts?'

'Have I seen a Crocodile?' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, in a
voice of dretful scorn. 'What will you ask me next?'

''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child, 'but could you kindly tell me
what he has for dinner?'

Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake uncoiled himself very quickly
from the rock, and spanked the Elephant's Child with his scalesome,
flailsome tail.

'That is odd,' said the Elephant's Child, 'because my father and my
mother, and my uncle and my aunt, not to mention my other aunt, the
Hippopotamus, and my other uncle, the Baboon, have all spanked me for my
'satiable curtiosity--and I suppose this is the same thing.

So he said good-bye very politely to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake,
and helped to coil him up on the rock again, and went on, a little warm,
but not at all astonished, eating melons, and throwing the rind about,
because he could not pick it up, till he trod on what he thought was
a log of wood at the very edge of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo
River, all set about with fever-trees.

But it was really the Crocodile, O Best Beloved, and the Crocodile
winked one eye--like this!

''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child most politely, 'but do you happen
to have seen a Crocodile in these promiscuous parts?'

Then the Crocodile winked the other eye, and lifted half his tail out of
the mud; and the Elephant's Child stepped back most politely, because he
did not wish to be spanked again.

'Come hither, Little One,' said the Crocodile. 'Why do you ask such
things?'

''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child most politely, 'but my father has
spanked me, my mother has spanked me, not to mention my tall aunt, the
Ostrich, and my tall uncle, the Giraffe, who can kick ever so hard, as
well as my broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and my hairy uncle, the Baboon,
and including the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, with the scalesome,
flailsome tail, just up the bank, who spanks harder than any of them;
and so, if it's quite all the same to you, I don't want to be spanked
any more.'

'Come hither, Little One,' said the Crocodile, 'for I am the Crocodile,'
and he wept crocodile-tears to show it was quite true.

Then the Elephant's Child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled
down on the bank and said, 'You are the very person I have been looking
for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for
dinner?'

'Come hither, Little One,' said the Crocodile, 'and I'll whisper.'

Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's
musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose,
which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger
than a boot, though much more useful.

'I think, said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like
this--'I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!'

At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he
said, speaking through his nose, like this, 'Led go! You are hurtig be!'

Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and
said, 'My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly,
pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in
the large-pattern leather ulster' (and by this he meant the Crocodile)
'will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack
Robinson.'

This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.

Then the Elephant's Child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled,
and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile
floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his
tail, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled.

And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's
Child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and
pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his
tail like an oar, and he pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each
pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him
hijjus!

Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through
his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, 'This is too butch for
be!'

Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and
knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's
hind legs, and said, 'Rash and inexperienced traveller, we will now
seriously devote ourselves to a little high tension, because if we do
not, it is my impression that yonder self-propelling man-of-war with
the armour-plated upper deck' (and by this, O Best Beloved, he meant the
Crocodile), 'will permanently vitiate your future career.

That is the way all Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snakes always talk.

So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled;
but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled
hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose
with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.

Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he
was careful to say 'Thank you' to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and
next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool
banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo to
cool.

'What are you doing that for?' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.

''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child, 'but my nose is badly out of
shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink.

'Then you will have to wait a long time, said the
Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'Some people do not know what is good for
them.'

The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to
shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint.
For, O Best Beloved, you will see and understand that the Crocodile
had pulled it out into a really truly trunk same as all Elephants have
to-day.

At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder,
and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that
fly dead with the end of it.

''Vantage number one!' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'You
couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little
now.'

Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his
trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his
fore-legs, and stuffed it into his own mouth.

'Vantage number two!' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'You
couldn't have done that with a mear-smear nose. Don't you think the sun
is very hot here?'

'It is,' said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was
doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great
grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a
cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.

'Vantage number three!' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'You
couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Now how do you feel
about being spanked again?'

''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child, 'but I should not like it at
all.'

'How would you like to spank somebody?' said the
Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.

'I should like it very much indeed,' said the Elephant's Child.

'Well,' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, 'you will find that new
nose of yours very useful to spank people with.'

'Thank you,' said the Elephant's Child, 'I'll remember that; and now I
think I'll go home to all my dear families and try.'

So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking
his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree,
instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass
he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he
used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree
and used it as fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool, slushy-squshy
mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through
Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than
several brass bands.

He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus (she was
no relation of his), and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the
Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk.
The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on
his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy Pachyderm.

One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up
his trunk and said, 'How do you do?' They were very glad to see him,
and immediately said, 'Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable
curtiosity.'

'Pooh,' said the Elephant's Child. 'I don't think you peoples know
anything about spanking; but I do, and I'll show you.' Then he uncurled
his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.

'O Bananas!' said they, 'where did you learn that trick, and what have
you done to your nose?'

'I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great
grey-green, greasy Limpopo River,' said the Elephant's Child. 'I asked
him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep.'

'It looks very ugly,' said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.

'It does,' said the Elephant's Child. 'But it's very useful,' and he
picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him
into a hornet's nest.

Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long
time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out
his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the
Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he
shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her
ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any
one touch Kolokolo Bird.

At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one
by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo
River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the
Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody any more; and ever
since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see,
besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk
of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.


     I Keep six honest serving-men:
       (They taught me all I knew)
     Their names are What and Where and When
       And How and Why and Who.
     I send them over land and sea,
       I send them east and west;
     But after they have worked for me,
       I give them all a rest.

     I let them rest from nine till five.
       For I am busy then,
     As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,
       For they are hungry men:
     But different folk have different views:
       I know a person small--
     She keeps ten million serving-men,
       Who get no rest at all!
     She sends 'em abroad on her own affairs,
       From the second she opens her eyes--
     One million Hows, two million Wheres,
       And seven million Whys!




THE SING-SONG OF OLD MAN KANGAROO

NOT always was the Kangaroo as now we do behold him, but a Different
Animal with four short legs. He was grey and he was woolly, and
his pride was inordinate: he danced on an outcrop in the middle of
Australia, and he went to the Little God Nqa.

He went to Nqa at six before breakfast, saying, 'Make me different from
all other animals by five this afternoon.'

Up jumped Nqa from his seat on the sandflat and shouted, 'Go away!'

He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced
on a rock-ledge in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Middle
God Nquing.

He went to Nquing at eight after breakfast, saying, 'Make me different
from all other animals; make me, also, wonderfully popular by five this
afternoon.'

Up jumped Nquing from his burrow in the spinifex and shouted, 'Go away!'

He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced
on a sandbank in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Big God
Nqong.

He went to Nqong at ten before dinner-time, saying, 'Make me different
from all other animals; make me popular and wonderfully run after by
five this afternoon.'

Up jumped Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan and shouted, 'Yes, I
will!'

Nqong called Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusty in the
sunshine, and showed him Kangaroo. Nqong said, 'Dingo! Wake up, Dingo!
Do you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit? He wants to be popular
and very truly run after. Dingo, make him SO!'

Up jumped Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--and said, 'What, that cat-rabbit?'

Off ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, grinning like a
coal-scuttle,--ran after Kangaroo.

Off went the proud Kangaroo on his four little legs like a bunny.

This, O Beloved of mine, ends the first part of the tale!

He ran through the desert; he ran through the mountains; he ran through
the salt-pans; he ran through the reed-beds; he ran through the blue
gums; he ran through the spinifex; he ran till his front legs ached.

He had to!

Still ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, grinning like a
rat-trap, never getting nearer, never getting farther,--ran after
Kangaroo.

He had to!

Still ran Kangaroo--Old Man Kangaroo. He ran through the ti-trees; he
ran through the mulga; he ran through the long grass; he ran through the
short grass; he ran through the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; he ran
till his hind legs ached.

He had to!

Still ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--hungrier and hungrier, grinning like
a horse-collar, never getting nearer, never getting farther; and they
came to the Wollgong River.

Now, there wasn't any bridge, and there wasn't any ferry-boat, and
Kangaroo didn't know how to get over; so he stood on his legs and
hopped.

He had to!

He hopped through the Flinders; he hopped through the Cinders; he
hopped through the deserts in the middle of Australia. He hopped like a
Kangaroo.

First he hopped one yard; then he hopped three yards; then he hopped
five yards; his legs growing stronger; his legs growing longer. He
hadn't any time for rest or refreshment, and he wanted them very much.

Still ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--very much bewildered, very much
hungry, and wondering what in the world or out of it made Old Man
Kangaroo hop.

For he hopped like a cricket; like a pea in a saucepan; or a new rubber
ball on a nursery floor.

He had to!

He tucked up his front legs; he hopped on his hind legs; he stuck out
his tail for a balance-weight behind him; and he hopped through the
Darling Downs.

He had to!

Still ran Dingo--Tired-Dog Dingo--hungrier and hungrier, very much
bewildered, and wondering when in the world or out of it would Old Man
Kangaroo stop.

Then came Nqong from his bath in the salt-pans, and said, 'It's five
o'clock.'

Down sat Dingo--Poor Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusky in the sunshine;
hung out his tongue and howled.

Down sat Kangaroo--Old Man Kangaroo--stuck out his tail like a
milking-stool behind him, and said, 'Thank goodness that's finished!'

Then said Nqong, who is always a gentleman, 'Why aren't you grateful to
Yellow-Dog Dingo? Why don't you thank him for all he has done for you?'

Then said Kangaroo--Tired Old Kangaroo--He's chased me out of the homes
of my childhood; he's chased me out of my regular meal-times; he's
altered my shape so I'll never get it back; and he's played Old Scratch
with my legs.'

Then said Nqong, 'Perhaps I'm mistaken, but didn't you ask me to make
you different from all other animals, as well as to make you very truly
sought after? And now it is five o'clock.'

'Yes,' said Kangaroo. 'I wish that I hadn't. I thought you would do it
by charms and incantations, but this is a practical joke.'

'Joke!' said Nqong from his bath in the blue gums. 'Say that again and
I'll whistle up Dingo and run your hind legs off.'

'No,' said the Kangaroo. 'I must apologise. Legs are legs, and you
needn't alter 'em so far as I am concerned. I only meant to explain to
Your Lordliness that I've had nothing to eat since morning, and I'm very
empty indeed.'

'Yes,' said Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo,--'I am just in the same situation.
I've made him different from all other animals; but what may I have for
my tea?'

Then said Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan, 'Come and ask me about it
tomorrow, because I'm going to wash.'

So they were left in the middle of Australia, Old Man Kangaroo and
Yellow-Dog Dingo, and each said, 'That's your fault.'


     THIS is the mouth-filling song
     Of the race that was run by a Boomer,
     Run in a single burst--only event of its kind--
     Started by big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma,
     Old Man Kangaroo first: Yellow-Dog Dingo behind.

     Kangaroo bounded away,
     His back-legs working like pistons--
     Bounded from morning till dark,
     Twenty-five feet to a bound.
     Yellow-Dog Dingo lay
     Like a yellow cloud in the distance--
     Much too busy to bark.
     My! but they covered the ground!

     Nobody knows where they went,
     Or followed the track that they flew in,
     For that Continent
     Hadn't been given a name.
     They ran thirty degrees,
     From Torres Straits to the Leeuwin
     (Look at the Atlas, please),
     And they ran back as they came.

     S'posing you could trot
     From Adelaide to the Pacific,
     For an afternoon's run
     Half what these gentlemen did
     You would feel rather hot,
     But your legs would develop terrific--
     Yes, my importunate son,
     You'd be a Marvellous Kid!




THE BEGINNING OF THE ARMADILLOS

THIS, O Best Beloved, is another story of the High and Far-Off Times.
In the very middle of those times was a Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog, and
he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating shelly snails and
things. And he had a friend, a Slow-Solid Tortoise, who lived on the
banks of the turbid Amazon, eating green lettuces and things. And so
that was all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?

But also, and at the same time, in those High and Far-Off Times, there
was a Painted Jaguar, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon
too; and he ate everything that he could catch. When he could not catch
deer or monkeys he would eat frogs and beetles; and when he could not
catch frogs and beetles he went to his Mother Jaguar, and she told him
how to eat hedgehogs and tortoises.

She said to him ever so many times, graciously waving her tail, 'My son,
when you find a Hedgehog you must drop him into the water and then he
will uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must scoop him out of his
shell with your paw.' And so that was all right, Best Beloved.

One beautiful night on the banks of the turbid Amazon, Painted Jaguar
found Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise sitting under the
trunk of a fallen tree. They could not run away, and so Stickly-Prickly
curled himself up into a ball, because he was a Hedgehog, and Slow-Solid
Tortoise drew in his head and feet into his shell as far as they would
go, because he was a Tortoise; and so that was all right, Best Beloved.
Do you see?

'Now attend to me,' said Painted Jaguar, 'because this is very
important. My mother said that when I meet a Hedgehog I am to drop him
into the water and then he will uncoil, and when I meet a Tortoise I am
to scoop him out of his shell with my paw. Now which of you is Hedgehog
and which is Tortoise? because, to save my spots, I can't tell.'

'Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?' said Stickly-Prickly
Hedgehog. 'Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you uncoil a
Tortoise you must shell him out the water with a scoop, and when you paw
a Hedgehog you must drop him on the shell.'

'Are you sure of what your Mummy told you?' said Slow-and-Solid
Tortoise. 'Are you quite sure? Perhaps she said that when you water a
Hedgehog you must drop him into your paw, and when you meet a Tortoise
you must shell him till he uncoils.'

'I don't think it was at all like that,' said Painted Jaguar, but he
felt a little puzzled; 'but, please, say it again more distinctly.'

'When you scoop water with your paw you uncoil it with a Hedgehog,' said
Stickly-Prickly. 'Remember that, because it's important.'

'But,' said the Tortoise, 'when you paw your meat you drop it into a
Tortoise with a scoop. Why can't you understand?'

'You are making my spots ache,' said Painted Jaguar; 'and besides, I
didn't want your advice at all. I only wanted to know which of you is
Hedgehog and which is Tortoise.'

'I shan't tell you,' said Stickly-Prickly, 'but you can scoop me out of
my shell if you like.'

'Aha!' said Painted Jaguar. 'Now I know you're Tortoise. You thought I
wouldn't! Now I will.' Painted Jaguar darted out his paddy-paw just as
Stickly-Prickly curled himself up, and of course Jaguar's paddy-paw was
just filled with prickles. Worse than that, he knocked Stickly-Prickly
away and away into the woods and the bushes, where it was too dark to
find him. Then he put his paddy-paw into his mouth, and of course the
prickles hurt him worse than ever. As soon as he could speak he said,
'Now I know he isn't Tortoise at all. But'--and then he scratched
his head with his un-prickly paw--'how do I know that this other is
Tortoise?'

'But I am Tortoise,' said Slow-and-Solid. Your mother was quite right.
She said that you were to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.
Begin.'

'You didn't say she said that a minute ago, said Painted Jaguar, sucking
the prickles out of his paddy-paw. 'You said she said something quite
different.'

'Well, suppose you say that I said that she said something quite
different, I don't see that it makes any difference; because if she said
what you said I said she said, it's just the same as if I said what she
said she said. On the other hand, if you think she said that you were to
uncoil me with a scoop, instead of pawing me into drops with a shell, I
can't help that, can I?'

'But you said you wanted to be scooped out of your shell with my paw,'
said Painted Jaguar.

'If you'll think again you'll find that I didn't say anything of the
kind. I said that your mother said that you were to scoop me out of my
shell,' said Slow-and-Solid.

'What will happen if I do?' said the Jaguar most sniffily and most
cautious.

'I don't know, because I've never been scooped out of my shell before;
but I tell you truly, if you want to see me swim away you've only got to
drop me into the water.

'I don't believe it,' said Painted Jaguar. 'You've mixed up all the
things my mother told me to do with the things that you asked me whether
I was sure that she didn't say, till I don't know whether I'm on my
head or my painted tail; and now you come and tell me something I can
understand, and it makes me more mixy than before. My mother told me
that I was to drop one of you two into the water, and as you seem so
anxious to be dropped I think you don't want to be dropped. So jump into
the turbid Amazon and be quick about it.'

'I warn you that your Mummy won't be pleased. Don't tell her I didn't
tell you,' said Slow-Solid.

'If you say another word about what my mother said--' the Jaguar
answered, but he had not finished the sentence before Slow-and-Solid
quietly dived into the turbid Amazon, swam under water for a long way,
and came out on the bank where Stickly-Prickly was waiting for him.

'That was a very narrow escape,' said Stickly-Prickly. 'I don't rib
Painted Jaguar. What did you tell him that you were?'

'I told him truthfully that I was a truthful Tortoise, but he wouldn't
believe it, and he made me jump into the river to see if I was, and I
was, and he is surprised. Now he's gone to tell his Mummy. Listen to
him!'

They could hear Painted Jaguar roaring up and down among the trees and
the bushes by the side of the turbid Amazon, till his Mummy came.

'Son, son!' said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her
tail, 'what have you been doing that you shouldn't have done?'

'I tried to scoop something that said it wanted to be scooped out of
its shell with my paw, and my paw is full of per-ickles,' said Painted
Jaguar.

'Son, son!' said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving her
tail, 'by the prickles in your paddy-paw I see that that must have been
a Hedgehog. You should have dropped him into the water.

'I did that to the other thing; and he said he was a Tortoise, and I
didn't believe him, and it was quite true, and he has dived under the
turbid Amazon, and he won't come up again, and I haven't anything at all
to eat, and I think we had better find lodgings somewhere else. They are
too clever on the turbid Amazon for poor me!'

'Son, son!' said his mother ever so many times, graciously waving
her tail, 'now attend to me and remember what I say. A Hedgehog curls
himself up into a ball and his prickles stick out every which way at
once. By this you may know the Hedgehog.'

'I don't like this old lady one little bit,' said Stickly-Prickly, under
the shadow of a large leaf. 'I wonder what else she knows?'

'A Tortoise can't curl himself up,' Mother Jaguar went on, ever so many
times, graciously waving her tail. 'He only draws his head and legs into
his shell. By this you may know the tortoise.'

'I don't like this old lady at all--at all,' said Slow-and-Solid
Tortoise. 'Even Painted Jaguar can't forget those directions. It's a
great pity that you can't swim, Stickly-Prickly.'

'Don't talk to me,' said Stickly-Prickly. 'Just think how much better
it would be if you could curl up. This is a mess! Listen to Painted
Jaguar.'

Painted Jaguar was sitting on the banks of the turbid Amazon sucking
prickles out of his Paws and saying to himself--

  'Can't curl, but can swim--
  Slow-Solid, that's him!
  Curls up, but can't swim--
  Stickly-Prickly, that's him!'

'He'll never forget that this month of Sundays,' said Stickly-Prickly.
'Hold up my chin, Slow-and-Solid. I'm going to try to learn to swim. It
may be useful.'

'Excellent!' said Slow-and-Solid; and he held up Stickly-Prickly's chin,
while Stickly-Prickly kicked in the waters of the turbid Amazon.

'You'll make a fine swimmer yet,' said Slow-and-Solid. 'Now, if you can
unlace my back-plates a little, I'll see what I can do towards curling
up. It may be useful.'

Stickly-Prickly helped to unlace Tortoise's back-plates, so that by
twisting and straining Slow-and-Solid actually managed to curl up a
tiddy wee bit.

'Excellent!' said Stickly-Prickly; 'but I shouldn't do any more just
now. It's making you black in the face. Kindly lead me into the water
once again and I'll practice that side-stroke which you say is so easy.'
And so Stickly-Prickly practiced, and Slow-Solid swam alongside.

'Excellent!' said Slow-and-Solid. 'A little more practice will make you
a regular whale. Now, if I may trouble you to unlace my back and front
plates two holes more, I'll try that fascinating bend that you say is so
easy. Won't Painted Jaguar be surprised!'

'Excellent!' said Stickly-Prickly, all wet from the turbid Amazon. 'I
declare, I shouldn't know you from one of my own family. Two holes, I
think, you said? A little more expression, please, and don't grunt quite
so much, or Painted Jaguar may hear us. When you've finished, I want
to try that long dive which you say is so easy. Won't Painted Jaguar be
surprised!'

And so Stickly-Prickly dived, and Slow-and-Solid dived alongside.

'Excellent!' said Slow-and-Solid. 'A leetle more attention to holding
your breath and you will be able to keep house at the bottom of the
turbid Amazon. Now I'll try that exercise of putting my hind legs round
my ears which you say is so peculiarly comfortable. Won't Painted Jaguar
be surprised!'

'Excellent!' said Stickly-Prickly. 'But it's straining your back-plates
a little. They are all overlapping now, instead of lying side by side.'

'Oh, that's the result of exercise,' said Slow-and-Solid. 'I've noticed
that your prickles seem to be melting into one another, and that
you're growing to look rather more like a pinecone, and less like a
chestnut-burr, than you used to.'

'Am I?' said Stickly-Prickly. 'That comes from my soaking in the water.
Oh, won't Painted Jaguar be surprised!'

They went on with their exercises, each helping the other, till morning
came; and when the sun was high they rested and dried themselves. Then
they saw that they were both of them quite different from what they had
been.

'Stickly-Prickly,' said Tortoise after breakfast, 'I am not what I was
yesterday; but I think that I may yet amuse Painted Jaguar.

'That was the very thing I was thinking just now,' said Stickly-Prickly.
'I think scales are a tremendous improvement on prickles--to say nothing
of being able to swim. Oh, won't Painted Jaguar be surprised! Let's go
and find him.'

By and by they found Painted Jaguar, still nursing his paddy-paw that
had been hurt the night before. He was so astonished that he fell three
times backward over his own painted tail without stopping.

'Good morning!' said Stickly-Prickly. 'And how is your dear gracious
Mummy this morning?'

'She is quite well, thank you,' said Painted Jaguar; 'but you must
forgive me if I do not at this precise moment recall your name.'

'That's unkind of you,' said Stickly-Prickly, 'seeing that this time
yesterday you tried to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.'

'But you hadn't any shell. It was all prickles,' said Painted Jaguar. 'I
know it was. Just look at my paw!'

'You told me to drop into the turbid Amazon and be drowned,' said
Slow-Solid. 'Why are you so rude and forgetful to-day?'

'Don't you remember what your mother told you?' said Stickly-Prickly,--

  'Can't curl, but can swim--
  Stickly-Prickly, that's him!
  Curls up, but can't swim--
  Slow-Solid, that's him!'

Then they both curled themselves up and rolled round and round Painted
Jaguar till his eyes turned truly cart-wheels in his head.

Then he went to fetch his mother.

'Mother,' he said, 'there are two new animals in the woods to-day, and
the one that you said couldn't swim, swims, and the one that you said
couldn't curl up, curls; and they've gone shares in their prickles, I
think, because both of them are scaly all over, instead of one being
smooth and the other very prickly; and, besides that, they are rolling
round and round in circles, and I don't feel comfy.'

'Son, son!' said Mother Jaguar ever so many times, graciously waving her
tail, 'a Hedgehog is a Hedgehog, and can't be anything but a Hedgehog;
and a Tortoise is a Tortoise, and can never be anything else.'

'But it isn't a Hedgehog, and it isn't a Tortoise. It's a little bit of
both, and I don't know its proper name.'

'Nonsense!' said Mother Jaguar. 'Everything has its proper name. I
should call it "Armadillo" till I found out the real one. And I should
leave it alone.'

So Painted Jaguar did as he was told, especially about leaving them
alone; but the curious thing is that from that day to this, O Best
Beloved, no one on the banks of the turbid Amazon has ever called
Stickly-Prickly and Slow-Solid anything except Armadillo. There are
Hedgehogs and Tortoises in other places, of course (there are some in
my garden); but the real old and clever kind, with their scales lying
lippety-lappety one over the other, like pine-cone scales, that lived on
the banks of the turbid Amazon in the High and Far-Off Days, are always
called Armadillos, because they were so clever.

So that; all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?

     I'VE never sailed the Amazon,
       I've never reached Brazil;
     But the Don and Magdelana,
       They can go there when they will!

             Yes, weekly from Southampton,
             Great steamers, white and gold,
             Go rolling down to Rio
             (Roll down--roll down to Rio!)
             And I'd like to roll to Rio
             Some day before I'm old!

     I've never seen a Jaguar,
       Nor yet an Armadill
     O dilloing in his armour,
       And I s'pose I never will,

             Unless I go to Rio
             These wonders to behold--
             Roll down--roll down to Rio--
             Roll really down to Rio!
             Oh, I'd love to roll to Rio
             Some day before I'm old!




HOW THE FIRST LETTER WAS WRITTEN

ONCE upon a most early time was a Neolithic man. He was not a Jute or an
Angle, or even a Dravidian, which he might well have been, Best Beloved,
but never mind why. He was a Primitive, and he lived cavily in a Cave,
and he wore very few clothes, and he couldn't read and he couldn't write
and he didn't want to, and except when he was hungry he was
quite happy. His name was Tegumai Bopsulai, and that means,
'Man-who-does-not-put-his-foot-forward-in-a-hurry'; but we, O Best
Beloved, will call him Tegumai, for short. And his wife's name
was Teshumai Tewindrow, and that means,
'Lady-who-asks-a-very-many-questions'; but we, O Best Beloved, will
call her Teshumai, for short. And his little girl-daughter's name
was Taffimai Metallumai, and that means,
'Small-person-without-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked'; but I'm
going to call her Taffy. And she was Tegumai Bopsulai's Best Beloved and
her own Mummy's Best Beloved, and she was not spanked half as much as
was good for her; and they were all three very happy. As soon as
Taffy could run about she went everywhere with her Daddy Tegumai, and
sometimes they would not come home to the Cave till they were hungry,
and then Teshumai Tewindrow would say, 'Where in the world have you two
been to, to get so shocking dirty? Really, my Tegumai, you're no better
than my Taffy.'

Now attend and listen!

One day Tegumai Bopsulai went down through the beaver-swamp to the Wagai
river to spear carp-fish for dinner, and Taffy went too. Tegumai's spear
was made of wood with shark's teeth at the end, and before he had caught
any fish at all he accidentally broke it clean across by jabbing it down
too hard on the bottom of the river. They were miles and miles from home
(of course they had their lunch with them in a little bag), and Tegumai
had forgotten to bring any extra spears.

'Here's a pretty kettle of fish!' said Tegumai. 'It will take me half
the day to mend this.'

'There's your big black spear at home,' said Taffy. 'Let me run back to
the Cave and ask Mummy to give it me.'

'It's too far for your little fat legs,' said Tegumai. 'Besides, you
might fall into the beaver-swamp and be drowned. We must make the best
of a bad job.' He sat down and took out a little leather mendy-bag, full
of reindeer-sinews and strips of leather, and lumps of bee's-wax and
resin, and began to mend the spear.

Taffy sat down too, with her toes in the water and her chin in her
hand, and thought very hard. Then she said--'I say, Daddy, it's an awful
nuisance that you and I don't know how to write, isn't it? If we did we
could send a message for the new spear.'

'Taffy,' said Tegumai, 'how often have I told you not to use slang?
"Awful" isn't a pretty word, but it could be a convenience, now you
mention it, if we could write home.'

Just then a Stranger-man came along the river, but he belonged to a
far tribe, the Tewaras, and he did not understand one word of Tegumai's
language. He stood on the bank and smiled at Taffy, because he had
a little girl-daughter Of his own at home. Tegumai drew a hank of
deer-sinews from his mendy-bag and began to mend his spear.

'Come here, said Taffy. 'Do you know where my Mummy lives?' And the
Stranger-man said 'Um!' being, as you know, a Tewara.

'Silly!' said Taffy, and she stamped her foot, because she saw a shoal
of very big carp going up the river just when her Daddy couldn't use his
spear.

'Don't bother grown-ups,' said Tegumai, so busy with his spear-mending
that he did not turn round.

'I aren't, said Taffy. 'I only want him to do what I want him to do, and
he won't understand.'

'Then don't bother me, said Tegumai, and he went on pulling and
straining at the deer-sinews with his mouth full of loose ends. The
Stranger-man--a genuine Tewara he was--sat down on the grass, and Taffy
showed him what her Daddy was doing. The Stranger-man thought, this is a
very wonderful child. She stamps her foot at me and she makes faces. She
must be the daughter of that noble Chief who is so great that he won't
take any notice of me.' So he smiled more politely than ever.

'Now,' said Taffy, 'I want you to go to my Mummy, because your legs are
longer than mine, and you won't fall into the beaver-swamp, and ask for
Daddy's other spear--the one with the black handle that hangs over our
fireplace.'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, 'This is a very, very
wonderful child. She waves her arms and she shouts at me, but I don't
understand a word of what she says. But if I don't do what she wants, I
greatly fear that that haughty Chief, Man-who-turns-his-back-on-callers,
will be angry.' He got up and twisted a big flat piece of bark off a
birch-tree and gave it to Taffy. He did this, Best Beloved, to show that
his heart was as white as the birch-bark and that he meant no harm; but
Taffy didn't quite understand.

'Oh!' said she. 'Now I see! You want my Mummy's living-address? Of
course I can't write, but I can draw pictures if I've anything sharp to
scratch with. Please lend me the shark's tooth off your necklace.'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) didn't say anything, So Taffy
put up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and seed and
shark-tooth necklace round his neck.

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, 'This is a very, very,
very wonderful child. The shark's tooth on my necklace is a magic
shark's tooth, and I was always told that if anybody touched it without
my leave they would immediately swell up or burst, but this
child doesn't swell up or burst, and that important Chief,
Man-who-attends-strictly-to-his-business, who has not yet taken any
notice of me at all, doesn't seem to be afraid that she will swell up or
burst. I had better be more polite.'

So he gave Taffy the shark's tooth, and she lay down flat on her tummy
with her legs in the air, like some people on the drawing-room floor
when they want to draw pictures, and she said, 'Now I'll draw you some
beautiful pictures! You can look over my shoulder, but you mustn't
joggle. First I'll draw Daddy fishing. It isn't very like him; but Mummy
will know, because I've drawn his spear all broken. Well, now I'll draw
the other spear that he wants, the black-handled spear. It looks as if
it was sticking in Daddy's back, but that's because the shark's tooth
slipped and this piece of bark isn't big enough. That's the spear I want
you to fetch; so I'll draw a picture of me myself 'splaining to you. My
hair doesn't stand up like I've drawn, but it's easier to draw that way.
Now I'll draw you. I think you're very nice really, but I can't make you
pretty in the picture, so you mustn't be 'fended. Are you 'fended?'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) smiled. He thought, 'There must
be a big battle going to be fought somewhere, and this extraordinary
child, who takes my magic shark's tooth but who does not swell up or
burst, is telling me to call all the great Chief's tribe to help him. He
is a great Chief, or he would have noticed me.

'Look,' said Taffy, drawing very hard and rather scratchily, 'now I've
drawn you, and I've put the spear that Daddy wants into your hand, just
to remind you that you're to bring it. Now I'll show you how to find my
Mummy's living-address. You go along till you come to two trees (those
are trees), and then you go over a hill (that's a hill), and then you
come into a beaver-swamp all full of beavers. I haven't put in all the
beavers, because I can't draw beavers, but I've drawn their heads, and
that's all you'll see of them when you cross the swamp. Mind you don't
fall in! Then our Cave is just beyond the beaver-swamp. It isn't as high
as the hills really, but I can't draw things very small. That's my Mummy
outside. She is beautiful. She is the most beautifullest Mummy there
ever was, but she won't be 'fended when she sees I've drawn her so
plain. She'll be pleased of me because I can draw. Now, in case you
forget, I've drawn the spear that Daddy wants outside our Cave. It's
inside really, but you show the picture to my Mummy and she'll give it
you. I've made her holding up her hands, because I know she'll be so
pleased to see you. Isn't it a beautiful picture? And do you quite
understand, or shall I 'splain again?'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) looked at the picture and nodded
very hard. He said to himself,' If I do not fetch this great Chief's
tribe to help him, he will be slain by his enemies who are coming up on
all sides with spears. Now I see why the great Chief pretended not to
notice me! He feared that his enemies were hiding in the bushes and
would see him. Therefore he turned to me his back, and let the wise and
wonderful child draw the terrible picture showing me his difficulties.
I will away and get help for him from his tribe.' He did not even ask
Taffy the road, but raced off into the bushes like the wind, with the
birch-bark in his hand, and Taffy sat down most pleased.

Now this is the picture that Taffy had drawn for him!

'What have you been doing, Taffy?' said Tegumai. He had mended his spear
and was carefully waving it to and fro.

'It's a little berangement of my own, Daddy dear,' said Taffy. 'If you
won't ask me questions, you'll know all about it in a little time, and
you'll be surprised. You don't know how surprised you'll be, Daddy!
Promise you'll be surprised.'

'Very well,' said Tegumai, and went on fishing.

The Stranger-man--did you know he was a Tewara?--hurried away with the
picture and ran for some miles, till quite by accident he found Teshumai
Tewindrow at the door of her Cave, talking to some other Neolithic
ladies who had come in to a Primitive lunch. Taffy was very like
Teshumai, especially about the upper part of the face and the eyes,
so the Stranger-man--always a pure Tewara--smiled politely and handed
Teshumai the birch-bark. He had run hard, so that he panted, and his
legs were scratched with brambles, but he still tried to be polite.

As soon as Teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything and flew
at the Stranger-man. The other Neolithic ladies at once knocked him down
and sat on him in a long line of six, while Teshumai pulled his hair.

'It's as plain as the nose on this Stranger-man's face,' she said. 'He
has stuck my Tegumai all full of spears, and frightened poor Taffy so
that her hair stands all on end; and not content with that, he brings
me a horrid picture of how it was done. Look!' She showed the picture to
all the Neolithic ladies sitting patiently on the Stranger-man. 'Here is
my Tegumai with his arm broken; here is a spear sticking into his back;
here is a man with a spear ready to throw; here is another man throwing
a spear from a Cave, and here are a whole pack of people' (they were
Taffy's beavers really, but they did look rather like people) 'coming up
behind Tegumai. Isn't it shocking!'

'Most shocking!' said the Neolithic ladies, and they filled the
Stranger-man's hair with mud (at which he was surprised), and they beat
upon the Reverberating Tribal Drums, and called together all the chiefs
of the Tribe of Tegumai, with their Hetmans and Dolmans, all Neguses,
Woons, and Akhoonds of the organisation, in addition to the Warlocks,
Angekoks, Juju-men, Bonzes, and the rest, who decided that before they
chopped the Stranger-man's head off he should instantly lead them down
to the river and show them where he had hidden poor Taffy.

By this time the Stranger-man (in spite of being a Tewara) was really
annoyed. They had filled his hair quite solid with mud; they had rolled
him up and down on knobby pebbles; they had sat upon him in a long
line of six; they had thumped him and bumped him till he could hardly
breathe; and though he did not understand their language, he was almost
sure that the names the Neolithic ladies called him were not ladylike.
However, he said nothing till all the Tribe of Tegumai were assembled,
and then he led them back to the bank of the Wagai river, and there they
found Taffy making daisy-chains, and Tegumai carefully spearing small
carp with his mended spear.

'Well, you have been quick!' said Taffy. 'But why did you bring so many
people? Daddy dear, this is my surprise. Are you surprised, Daddy?'

'Very,' said Tegumai; 'but it has ruined all my fishing for the day.
Why, the whole dear, kind, nice, clean, quiet Tribe is here, Taffy.'

And so they were. First of all walked Teshumai Tewindrow and the
Neolithic ladies, tightly holding on to the Stranger-man, whose hair was
full of mud (although he was a Tewara). Behind them came the Head Chief,
the Vice-Chief, the Deputy and Assistant Chiefs (all armed to the upper
teeth), the Hetmans and Heads of Hundreds, Platoffs with their Platoons,
and Dolmans with their Detachments; Woons, Neguses, and Akhoonds ranking
in the rear (still armed to the teeth). Behind them was the Tribe in
hierarchical order, from owners of four caves (one for each season), a
private reindeer-run, and two salmon-leaps, to feudal and prognathous
Villeins, semi-entitled to half a bearskin of winter nights, seven yards
from the fire, and adscript serfs, holding the reversion of a scraped
marrow-bone under heriot (Aren't those beautiful words, Best Beloved?).
They were all there, prancing and shouting, and they frightened every
fish for twenty miles, and Tegumai thanked them in a fluid Neolithic
oration.

Then Teshumai Tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged Taffy very much
indeed; but the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai took Tegumai by the
top-knot feathers and shook him severely.

'Explain! Explain! Explain!' cried all the Tribe of Tegumai.

'Goodness' sakes alive!' said Tegumai. 'Let go of my top-knot. Can't
a man break his carp-spear without the whole countryside descending on
him? You're a very interfering people.'

'I don't believe you've brought my Daddy's black-handled spear after
all,' said Taffy. 'And what are you doing to my nice Stranger-man?'

They were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes turned
round and round. He could only gasp and point at Taffy.

'Where are the bad people who speared you, my darling?' said Teshumai
Tewindrow.

'There weren't any,' said Tegumai. 'My only visitor this morning was the
poor fellow that you are trying to choke. Aren't you well, or are you
ill, O Tribe of Tegumai?'

'He came with a horrible picture,' said the Head Chief,--'a picture that
showed you were full of spears.'

'Er-um-Pr'aps I'd better 'splain that I gave him that picture,' said
Taffy, but she did not feel quite comfy.

'You!' said the Tribe of Tegumai all together.
'Small-person-with-no-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked! You?'

'Taffy dear, I'm afraid we're in for a little trouble,' said her Daddy,
and put his arm round her, so she didn't care.

'Explain! Explain! Explain!' said the Head Chief of the Tribe of
Tegumai, and he hopped on one foot.

'I wanted the Stranger-man to fetch Daddy's spear, so I drawded it,'
said Taffy. 'There wasn't lots of spears. There was only one spear. I
drawded it three times to make sure. I couldn't help it looking as if it
stuck into Daddy's head--there wasn't room on the birch-bark; and those
things that Mummy called bad people are my beavers. I drawded them to
show him the way through the swamp; and I drawded Mummy at the mouth of
the Cave looking pleased because he is a nice Stranger-man, and I think
you are just the stupidest people in the world,' said Taffy. 'He is a
very nice man. Why have you filled his hair with mud? Wash him!'

Nobody said anything at all for a longtime, till the Head Chief laughed;
then the Stranger-man (who was at least a Tewara) laughed; then Tegumai
laughed till he fell down flat on the bank; then all the Tribe laughed
more and worse and louder. The only people who did not laugh were
Teshumai Tewindrow and all the Neolithic ladies. They were very polite
to all their husbands, and said 'Idiot!' ever so often.

Then the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai cried and said and sang, 'O
Small-person-with-out-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked, you've hit
upon a great invention!'

'I didn't intend to; I only wanted Daddy's black-handled spear,' said
Taffy.

'Never mind. It is a great invention, and some day men will call it
writing. At present it is only pictures, and, as we have seen to-day,
pictures are not always properly understood. But a time will come, O
Babe of Tegumai, when we shall make letters--all twenty-six of 'em,--and
when we shall be able to read as well as to write, and then we shall
always say exactly what we mean without any mistakes. Let the Neolithic
ladies wash the mud out of the stranger's hair.'

'I shall be glad of that,' said Taffy, 'because, after all, though
you've brought every single other spear in the Tribe of Tegumai, you've
forgotten my Daddy's black-handled spear.'

Then the Head Chief cried and said and sang, 'Taffy dear, the next time
you write a picture-letter, you'd better send a man who can talk our
language with it, to explain what it means. I don't mind it myself,
because I am a Head Chief, but it's very bad for the rest of the Tribe
of Tegumai, and, as you can see, it surprises the stranger.'

Then they adopted the Stranger-man (a genuine Tewara of Tewar) into the
Tribe of Tegumai, because he was a gentleman and did not make a fuss
about the mud that the Neolithic ladies had put into his hair. But
from that day to this (and I suppose it is all Taffy's fault), very few
little girls have ever liked learning to read or write. Most of them
prefer to draw pictures and play about with their Daddies--just like
Taffy.


     THERE runs a road by Merrow Down--
       A grassy track to-day it is
     An hour out of Guildford town,
       Above the river Wey it is.

     Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,
       The ancient Britons dressed and rode
     To watch the dark Phoenicians bring
       Their goods along the Western Road.

     And here, or hereabouts, they met
       To hold their racial talks and such--
     To barter beads for Whitby jet,
       And tin for gay shell torques and such.

     But long and long before that time
       (When bison used to roam on it)
     Did Taffy and her Daddy climb
       That down, and had their home on it.

     Then beavers built in Broadstone brook
       And made a swamp where Bramley stands:
     And hears from Shere would come and look
       For Taffimai where Shamley stands.

     The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,
       Was more than six times bigger then;
     And all the Tribe of Tegumai
       They cut a noble figure then!




HOW THE ALPHABET WAS MADE

THE week after Taffimai Metallumai (we will still call her Taffy,
Best Beloved) made that little mistake about her Daddy's spear and the
Stranger-man and the picture-letter and all, she went carp-fishing again
with her Daddy. Her Mummy wanted her to stay at home and help hang up
hides to dry on the big drying-poles outside their Neolithic Cave,
but Taffy slipped away down to her Daddy quite early, and they fished.
Presently she began to giggle, and her Daddy said, 'Don't be silly,
child.'

'But wasn't it inciting!' said Taffy. 'Don't you remember how the Head
Chief puffed out his cheeks, and how funny the nice Stranger-man looked
with the mud in his hair?'

'Well do I,' said Tegumai. 'I had to pay two deerskins--soft ones with
fringes--to the Stranger-man for the things we did to him.'

'We didn't do anything,' said Taffy. 'It was Mummy and the other
Neolithic ladies--and the mud.'

'We won't talk about that,' said her Daddy, 'Let's have lunch.'

Taffy took a marrow-bone and sat mousy-quiet for ten whole minutes,
while her Daddy scratched on pieces of birch-bark with a shark's tooth.
Then she said, 'Daddy, I've thinked of a secret surprise. You make a
noise--any sort of noise.'

'Ah!' said Tegumai. 'Will that do to begin with?'

'Yes,' said Taffy. 'You look just like a carp-fish with its mouth open.
Say it again, please.'

'Ah! ah! ah!' said her Daddy. 'Don't be rude, my daughter.'

'I'm not meaning rude, really and truly,' said Taffy. 'It's part of my
secret-surprise-think. Do say ah, Daddy, and keep your mouth open at
the end, and lend me that tooth. I'm going to draw a carp-fish's mouth
wide-open.'

'What for?' said her Daddy.

'Don't you see?' said Taffy, scratching away on the bark. 'That will be
our little secret s'prise. When I draw a carp-fish with his mouth open
in the smoke at the back of our Cave--if Mummy doesn't mind--it will
remind you of that ah-noise. Then we can play that it was me jumped
out of the dark and s'prised you with that noise--same as I did in the
beaver-swamp last winter.'

'Really?' said her Daddy, in the voice that grown-ups use when they are
truly attending. 'Go on, Taffy.'

'Oh bother!' she said. 'I can't draw all of a carp-fish, but I can draw
something that means a carp-fish's mouth. Don't you know how they stand
on their heads rooting in the mud? Well, here's a pretence carp-fish (we
can play that the rest of him is drawn). Here's just his mouth, and that
means ah.' And she drew this. (1.)

'That's not bad,' said Tegumai, and scratched on his own piece of bark
for himself; but you've forgotten the feeler that hangs across his
mouth.'

'But I can't draw, Daddy.'

'You needn't draw anything of him except just the opening of his mouth
and the feeler across. Then we'll know he's a carp-fish, 'cause the
perches and trouts haven't got feelers. Look here, Taffy.' And he drew
this. (2.)

'Now I'll copy it.' said Taffy. 'Will you understand this when you see
it?'

'Perfectly,' said her Daddy.

And she drew this. (3.) 'And I'll be quite as s'prised when I see it
anywhere, as if you had jumped out from behind a tree and said '"Ah!"'

'Now, make another noise,' said Taffy, very proud.

'Yah!' said her Daddy, very loud.

'H'm,' said Taffy. 'That's a mixy noise. The end part is
ah-carp-fish-mouth; but what can we do about the front part? Yer-yer-yer
and ah! Ya!'

'It's very like the carp-fish-mouth noise. Let's draw another bit of the
carp-fish and join 'em,' said her Daddy. He was quite incited too.

'No. If they're joined, I'll forget. Draw it separate. Draw his tail.
If he's standing on his head the tail will come first. 'Sides, I think I
can draw tails easiest,' said Taffy.

'A good notion,' said Tegumai. 'Here's a carp-fish tail for the
yer-noise.' And he drew this. (4.)

'I'll try now,' said Taffy. ''Member I can't draw like you, Daddy. Will
it do if I just draw the split part of the tail, and the sticky-down
line for where it joins?' And she drew this. (5.)

Her Daddy nodded, and his eyes were shiny bright with 'citement.

'That's beautiful,' she said. 'Now make another noise, Daddy.'

'Oh!' said her Daddy, very loud.

'That's quite easy,' said Taffy. 'You make your mouth all around like an
egg or a stone. So an egg or a stone will do for that.'

'You can't always find eggs or stones. We'll have to scratch a round
something like one.' And he drew this. (6.)

'My gracious!' said Taffy, 'what a lot of noise-pictures we've
made,--carp-mouth, carp-tail, and egg! Now, make another noise, Daddy.'

'Ssh!' said her Daddy, and frowned to himself, but Taffy was too incited
to notice.

'That's quite easy,' she said, scratching on the bark.

'Eh, what?' said her Daddy. 'I meant I was thinking, and didn't want to
be disturbed.'

'It's a noise just the same. It's the noise a snake makes, Daddy,
when it is thinking and doesn't want to be disturbed. Let's make the
ssh-noise a snake. Will this do?' And she drew this. (7.)

'There,' she said. 'That's another s'prise-secret. When you draw a
hissy-snake by the door of your little back-cave where you mend
the spears, I'll know you're thinking hard; and I'll come in most
mousy-quiet. And if you draw it on a tree by the river when you are
fishing, I'll know you want me to walk most most mousy-quiet, so as not
to shake the banks.'

'Perfectly true,' said Tegumai. And there's more in this game than you
think. Taffy, dear, I've a notion that your Daddy's daughter has hit
upon the finest thing that there ever was since the Tribe of Tegumai
took to using shark's teeth instead of flints for their spear-heads. I
believe we've found out the big secret of the world.'

'Why?' said Taffy, and her eyes shone too with incitement.

'I'll show,' said her Daddy. 'What's water in the Tegumai language?'

'Ya, of course, and it means river too--like Wagai-ya--the Wagai river.'

'What is bad water that gives you fever if you drink it--black
water--swamp-water?'

'Yo, of course.'

'Now look,' said her Daddy. 'S'pose you saw this scratched by the side
of a pool in the beaver-swamp?' And he drew this. (8.)

'Carp-tail and round egg. Two noises mixed! Yo, bad water,' said Taffy.
''Course I wouldn't drink that water because I'd know you said it was
bad.'

'But I needn't be near the water at all. I might be miles away, hunting,
and still--'

'And still it would be just the same as if you stood there and said,
"G'way, Taffy, or you'll get fever." All that in a carp-fish-tail and
a round egg! O Daddy, we must tell Mummy, quick!' and Taffy danced all
round him.

'Not yet,' said Tegumai; 'not till we've gone a little further. Let's
see. Yo is bad water, but So is food cooked on the fire, isn't it?' And
he drew this. (9.)

'Yes. Snake and egg,' said Taffy 'So that means dinner's ready. If you
saw that scratched on a tree you'd know it was time to come to the Cave.
So'd I.'

'My Winkie!' said Tegumai. 'That's true too. But wait a minute. I see
a difficulty. SO means "come and have dinner," but sho means the
drying-poles where we hang our hides.'

'Horrid old drying-poles!' said Taffy. 'I hate helping to hang heavy,
hot, hairy hides on them. If you drew the snake and egg, and I thought
it meant dinner, and I came in from the wood and found that it meant I
was to help Mummy hang the two hides on the drying-poles, what would I
do?'

'You'd be cross. So'd Mummy. We must make a new picture for sho. We must
draw a spotty snake that hisses sh-sh, and we'll play that the plain
snake only hisses ssss.'

'I couldn't be sure how to put in the spots,' said Taffy. 'And p'raps
if you were in a hurry you might leave them out, and I'd think it was
so when it was sho, and then Mummy would catch me just the same. No! I
think we'd better draw a picture of the horrid high drying-poles their
very selves, and make quite sure. I'll put them in just after the
hissy-snake. Look!' And she drew this. (10.)

'P'raps that's safest. It's very like our drying-poles, anyhow,'
said her Daddy, laughing. 'Now I'll make a new noise with a snake and
drying-pole sound in it. I'll say shi. That's Tegumai for spear, Taffy.'
And he laughed.

'Don't make fun of me,' said Taffy, as she thought of her picture-letter
and the mud in the Stranger-man's hair. 'You draw it, Daddy.'

'We won't have beavers or hills this time, eh?' said her Daddy, 'I'll
just draw a straight line for my spear.' and he drew this. (11.)

'Even Mummy couldn't mistake that for me being killed.'

'Please don't, Daddy. It makes me uncomfy. Do some more noises. We're
getting on beautifully.'

'Er-hm!' said Tegumai, looking up. 'We'll say shu. That means sky.'

Taffy drew the snake and the drying-pole. Then she stopped. 'We must
make a new picture for that end sound, mustn't we?'

'Shu-shu-u-u-u!' said her Daddy. 'Why, it's just like the
round-egg-sound made thin.'

'Then s'pose we draw a thin round egg, and pretend it's a frog that
hasn't eaten anything for years.'

'N-no,' said her Daddy. 'If we drew that in a hurry we might mistake it
for the round egg itself. Shu-shu-shu! 'I tell you what we'll do. We'll
open a little hole at the end of the round egg to show how the O-noise
runs out all thin, ooo-oo-oo. Like this.' And he drew this. (12.)

'Oh, that's lovely! Much better than a thin frog. Go on,' said Taffy,
using her shark's tooth. Her Daddy went on drawing, and his hand shook
with incitement. He went on till he had drawn this. (13.)

'Don't look up, Taffy,' he said. 'Try if you can make out what that
means in the Tegumai language. If you can, we've found the Secret.'

'Snake--pole--broken--egg--carp--tail and carp-mouth,' said Taffy.
'Shu-ya. Sky-water (rain).' Just then a drop fell on her hand, for the
day had clouded over. 'Why, Daddy, it's raining. Was that what you meant
to tell me?'

'Of course,' said her Daddy. 'And I told it you without saying a word,
didn't I?'

'Well, I think I would have known it in a minute, but that raindrop made
me quite sure. I'll always remember now. Shu-ya means rain, or "it is
going to rain." Why, Daddy!' She got up and danced round him. 'S'pose
you went out before I was awake, and drawed shu-ya in the smoke on the
wall, I'd know it was going to rain and I'd take my beaver-skin hood.
Wouldn't Mummy be surprised?'

Tegumai got up and danced. (Daddies didn't mind doing those things in
those days.) 'More than that! More than that!' he said. 'S'pose I wanted
to tell you it wasn't going to rain much and you must come down to the
river, what would we draw? Say the words in Tegumai-talk first.'

'Shu-ya-las, ya maru. (Sky-water ending. River come to.) what a lot of
new sounds! I don't see how we can draw them.'

'But I do--but I do!' said Tegumai. 'Just attend a minute, Taffy, and
we won't do any more to-day. We've got shu-ya all right, haven't we? But
this las is a teaser. La-la-la' and he waved his shark-tooth.

'There's the hissy-snake at the end and the carp-mouth before the
snake--as-as-as. We only want la-la,' said Taffy.

'I know it, but we have to make la-la. And we're the first people in all
the world who've ever tried to do it, Taffimai!'

'Well,' said Taffy, yawning, for she was rather tired. 'Las means
breaking or finishing as well as ending, doesn't it?'

'So it does,' said Tegumai. 'To-las means that there's no water in the
tank for Mummy to cook with--just when I'm going hunting, too.'

'And shi-las means that your spear is broken. If I'd only thought of
that instead of drawing silly beaver pictures for the Stranger!'

'La! La! La!' said Tegumai, waiving his stick and frowning. 'Oh bother!'

'I could have drawn shi quite easily,' Taffy went on. 'Then I'd have
drawn your spear all broken--this way!' And she drew. (14.)

'The very thing,' said Tegumai. 'That's la all over. It isn't like any
of the other marks either.' And he drew this. (15.)

'Now for ya. Oh, we've done that before. Now for maru. Mum-mum-mum. Mum
shuts one's mouth up, doesn't it? We'll draw a shut mouth like this.'
And he drew. (16.)

'Then the carp-mouth open. That makes Ma-ma-ma! But what about this
rrrrr-thing, Taffy?'

'It sounds all rough and edgy, like your shark-tooth saw when you're
cutting out a plank for the canoe,' said Taffy.

'You mean all sharp at the edges, like this?' said Tegumai. And he drew.
(17.)

''Xactly,' said Taffy. 'But we don't want all those teeth: only put
two.'

'I'll only put in one,' said Tegumai. 'If this game of ours is going
to be what I think it will, the easier we make our sound-pictures the
better for everybody.' And he drew. (18.)

'Now, we've got it,' said Tegumai, standing on one leg. 'I'll draw 'em
all in a string like fish.'

'Hadn't we better put a little bit of stick or something between each
word, so's they won't rub up against each other and jostle, same as if
they were carps?'

'Oh, I'll leave a space for that,' said her Daddy. And very incitedly he
drew them all without stopping, on a big new bit of birch-bark. (19.)

'Shu-ya-las ya-maru,' said Taffy, reading it out sound by sound.


'That's enough for to-day,' said Tegumai. 'Besides, you're getting
tired, Taffy. Never mind, dear. We'll finish it all to-morrow, and then
we'll be remembered for years and years after the biggest trees you can
see are all chopped up for firewood.'

So they went home, and all that evening Tegumai sat on one side of the
fire and Taffy on the other, drawing ya's and yo's and shu's and shi's
in the smoke on the wall and giggling together till her Mummy said,
'Really, Tegumai, you're worse than my Taffy.'

'Please don't mind,' said Taffy. 'It's only our secret-s'prise, Mummy
dear, and we'll tell you all about it the very minute it's done; but
please don't ask me what it is now, or else I'll have to tell.'

So her Mummy most carefully didn't; and bright and early next morning
Tegumai went down to the river to think about new sound pictures,
and when Taffy got up she saw Ya-las (water is ending or running out)
chalked on the side of the big stone water-tank, outside the Cave.

'Um,' said Taffy. 'These picture-sounds are rather a bother! Daddy's
just as good as come here himself and told me to get more water for
Mummy to cook with.' She went to the spring at the back of the house and
filled the tank from a bark bucket, and then she ran down to the river
and pulled her Daddy's left ear--the one that belonged to her to pull
when she was good.

'Now come along and we'll draw all the left-over sound-pictures,' said
her Daddy, and they had a most inciting day of it, and a beautiful lunch
in the middle, and two games of romps. When they came to T, Taffy said
that as her name, and her Daddy's, and her Mummy's all began with that
sound, they should draw a sort of family group of themselves holding
hands. That was all very well to draw once or twice; but when it came to
drawing it six or seven times, Taffy and Tegumai drew it scratchier and
scratchier, till at last the T-sound was only a thin long Tegumai with
his arms out to hold Taffy and Teshumai. You can see from these three
pictures partly how it happened. (20, 21, 22.)

Many of the other pictures were much too beautiful to begin with,
especially before lunch, but as they were drawn over and over again on
birch-bark, they became plainer and easier, till at last even Tegumai
said he could find no fault with them. They turned the hissy-snake the
other way round for the Z-sound, to show it was hissing backwards in a
soft and gentle way (23); and they just made a twiddle for E, because
it came into the pictures so often (24); and they drew pictures of the
sacred Beaver of the Tegumais for the B-sound (25, 26, 27, 28); and
because it was a nasty, nosy noise, they just drew noses for the
N-sound, till they were tired (29); and they drew a picture of the big
lake-pike's mouth for the greedy Ga-sound (30); and they drew the pike's
mouth again with a spear behind it for the scratchy, hurty Ka-sound
(31); and they drew pictures of a little bit of the winding Wagai river
for the nice windy-windy Wa-sound (32, 33); and so on and so forth and
so following till they had done and drawn all the sound-pictures that
they wanted, and there was the Alphabet, all complete.

And after thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and after
Hieroglyphics and Demotics, and Nilotics, and Cryptics, and Cufics, and
Runics, and Dorics, and Ionics, and all sorts of other ricks and
tricks (because the Woons, and the Neguses, and the Akhoonds, and the
Repositories of Tradition would never leave a good thing alone when they
saw it), the fine old easy, understandable Alphabet--A, B, C, D, E,
and the rest of 'em--got back into its proper shape again for all Best
Beloveds to learn when they are old enough.

But I remember Tegumai Bopsulai, and Taffimai Metallumai and Teshumai
Tewindrow, her dear Mummy, and all the days gone by. And it was so--just
so--a little time ago--on the banks of the big Wagai!

     OF all the Tribe of Tegumai
       Who cut that figure, none remain,--
     On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry
       The silence and the sun remain.

     But as the faithful years return
       And hearts unwounded sing again,
     Comes Taffy dancing through the fern
       To lead the Surrey spring again.

     Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,
       And golden elf-locks fly above;
     Her eyes are bright as diamonds
       And bluer than the skies above.

     In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,
       Unfearing, free and fair she flits,
     And lights her little damp-wood smoke
       To show her Daddy where she flits.

     For far--oh, very far behind,
       So far she cannot call to him,
     Comes Tegumai alone to find
       The daughter that was all to him.




THE CRAB THAT PLAYED WITH THE SEA

BEFORE the High and Far-Off Times, O my Best Beloved, came the Time of
the Very Beginnings; and that was in the days when the Eldest Magician
was getting Things ready. First he got the Earth ready; then he got the
Sea ready; and then he told all the Animals that they could come out and
play. And the Animals said, 'O Eldest Magician, what shall we play
at?' and he said, 'I will show you. He took the
Elephant--All-the-Elephant-there-was--and said, 'Play at being
an Elephant,' and All-the-Elephant-there-was played. He took the
Beaver--All-the-Beaver-there-was and said, 'Play at being a Beaver,'
and All-the Beaver-there-was played. He took the Cow--All-the
Cow-there-was--and said, 'Play at being a Cow,' and
All-the-Cow-there-was played. He took the Turtle--All-the-Turtle
there-was and said, 'Play at being a Turtle,' and
All-the-Turtle-there-was played. One by one he took all the beasts and
birds and fishes and told them what to play at.

But towards evening, when people and things grow restless and tired,
there came up the Man (With his own little girl-daughter?)--Yes, with
his own best beloved little girl-daughter sitting upon his shoulder, and
he said, 'What is this play, Eldest Magician?' And the Eldest Magician
said, 'Ho, Son of Adam, this is the play of the Very Beginning; but you
are too wise for this play.' And the Man saluted and said, 'Yes, I am
too wise for this play; but see that you make all the Animals obedient
to me.'

Now, while the two were talking together, Pau Amma the Crab, who was
next in the game, scuttled off sideways and stepped into the sea, saying
to himself, 'I will play my play alone in the deep waters, and I will
never be obedient to this son of Adam.' Nobody saw him go away except
the little girl-daughter where she leaned on the Man's shoulder. And the
play went on till there were no more Animals left without orders; and
the Eldest Magician wiped the fine dust off his hands and walked about
the world to see how the Animals were playing.

He went North, Best Beloved, and he found All-the-Elephant-there-was
digging with his tusks and stamping with his feet in the nice new clean
earth that had been made ready for him.

'Kun?' said All-the-Elephant-there-was, meaning, 'Is this right?'

'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician, meaning, 'That is quite
right'; and he breathed upon the great rocks and lumps of earth that
All-the-Elephant-there-was had thrown up, and they became the great
Himalayan Mountains, and you can look them out on the map.

He went East, and he found All-the-Cow there-was feeding in the field
that had been made ready for her, and she licked her tongue round a
whole forest at a time, and swallowed it and sat down to chew her cud.

'Kun?' said All-the-Cow-there-was.

'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the bare
patch where she had eaten, and upon the place where she had sat down,
and one became the great Indian Desert, and the other became the Desert
of Sahara, and you can look them out on the map.

He went West, and he found All-the-Beaver-there-was making a beaver-dam
across the mouths of broad rivers that had been got ready for him.

'Kun?' said All-the-Beaver-there-was.

'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the fallen
trees and the still water, and they became the Everglades in Florida,
and you may look them out on the map.

Then he went South and found All-the-Turtle-there-was scratching with
his flippers in the sand that had been got ready for him, and the sand
and the rocks whirled through the air and fell far off into the sea.

'Kun?' said All-the-Turtle-there-was.

'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician; and he breathed upon the sand and
the rocks, where they had fallen in the sea, and they became the most
beautiful islands of Borneo, Celebes, Sumatra, Java, and the rest of the
Malay Archipelago, and you can look them out on the map!

By and by the Eldest Magician met the Man on the banks of the Perak
river, and said, 'Ho! Son of Adam, are all the Animals obedient to you?'

'Yes,' said the Man.

'Is all the Earth obedient to you?'

'Yes,' said the Man.

'Is all the Sea obedient to you?'

'No,' said the Man. 'Once a day and once a night the Sea runs up the
Perak river and drives the sweet-water back into the forest, so that my
house is made wet; once a day and once a night it runs down the river
and draws all the water after it, so that there is nothing left but mud,
and my canoe is upset. Is that the play you told it to play?'

'No,' said the Eldest Magician. 'That is a new and a bad play.'

'Look!' said the Man, and as he spoke the great Sea came up the mouth of
the Perak river, driving the river backwards till it overflowed all the
dark forests for miles and miles, and flooded the Man's house.

'This is wrong. Launch your canoe and we will find out who is playing
with the Sea,' said the Eldest Magician. They stepped into the canoe;
the little girl-daughter came with them; and the Man took his kris--a
curving, wavy dagger with a blade like a flame,--and they pushed out on
the Perak river. Then the sea began to run back and back, and the canoe
was sucked out of the mouth of the Perak river, past Selangor, past
Malacca, past Singapore, out and out to the Island of Bingtang, as
though it had been pulled by a string.

Then the Eldest Magician stood up and shouted, 'Ho! beasts, birds, and
fishes, that I took between my hands at the Very Beginning and taught
the play that you should play, which one of you is playing with the
Sea?'

Then all the beasts, birds, and fishes said together, 'Eldest Magician,
we play the plays that you taught us to play--we and our children's
children. But not one of us plays with the Sea.'

Then the Moon rose big and full over the water, and the Eldest Magician
said to the hunchbacked old man who sits in the Moon spinning a
fishing-line with which he hopes one day to catch the world, 'Ho! Fisher
of the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?'

'No,' said the Fisherman, 'I am spinning a line with which I shall some
day catch the world; but I do not play with the Sea.' And he went on
spinning his line.

Now there is also a Rat up in the Moon who always bites the old
Fisherman's line as fast as it is made, and the Eldest Magician said to
him, 'Ho! Rat of the Moon, are you playing with the Sea?'

And the Rat said, 'I am too busy biting through the line that this
old Fisherman is spinning. I do not play with the Sea.' And he went on
biting the line.

Then the little girl-daughter put up her little soft brown arms with the
beautiful white shell bracelets and said, 'O Eldest Magician! when my
father here talked to you at the Very Beginning, and I leaned upon his
shoulder while the beasts were being taught their plays, one beast went
away naughtily into the Sea before you had taught him his play.

And the Eldest Magician said, 'How wise are little children who see and
are silent! What was the beast like?'

And the little girl-daughter said, 'He was round and he was flat; and
his eyes grew upon stalks; and he walked sideways like this; and he was
covered with strong armour upon his back.'

And the Eldest Magician said, 'How wise are little children who speak
truth! Now I know where Pau Amma went. Give me the paddle!'

So he took the paddle; but there was no need to paddle, for the water
flowed steadily past all the islands till they came to the place called
Pusat Tasek--the Heart of the Sea--where the great hollow is that leads
down to the heart of the world, and in that hollow grows the Wonderful
Tree, Pauh Janggi, that bears the magic twin nuts. Then the Eldest
Magician slid his arm up to the shoulder through the deep warm water,
and under the roots of the Wonderful Tree he touched the broad back of
Pau Amma the Crab. And Pau Amma settled down at the touch, and all the
Sea rose up as water rises in a basin when you put your hand into it.

'Ah!' said the Eldest Magician. 'Now I know who has been playing with
the Sea;' and he called out, 'What are you doing, Pau Amma?'

And Pau Amma, deep down below, answered, 'Once a day and once a night I
go out to look for my food. Once a day and once a night I return. Leave
me alone.'

Then the Eldest Magician said, 'Listen, Pau Amma. When you go out from
your cave the waters of the Sea pour down into Pusat Tasek, and all the
beaches of all the islands are left bare, and the little fish die, and
Raja Moyang Kaban, the King of the Elephants, his legs are made muddy.
When you come back and sit in Pusat Tasek, the waters of the Sea rise,
and half the little islands are drowned, and the Man's house is flooded,
and Raja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, his mouth is filled with
the salt water.

Then Pau Amma, deep down below, laughed and said, 'I did not know I
was so important. Henceforward I will go out seven times a day, and the
waters shall never be still.'

And the Eldest Magician said, 'I cannot make you play the play you were
meant to play, Pau Amma, because you escaped me at the Very Beginning;
but if you are not afraid, come up and we will talk about it.'

'I am not afraid,' said Pau Amma, and he rose to the top of the sea in
the moonlight. There was nobody in the world so big as Pau Amma--for he
was the King Crab of all Crabs. Not a common Crab, but a King Crab. One
side of his great shell touched the beach at Sarawak; the other
touched the beach at Pahang; and he was taller than the smoke of three
volcanoes! As he rose up through the branches of the Wonderful Tree he
tore off one of the great twin fruits--the magic double kernelled nuts
that make people young,--and the little girl-daughter saw it bobbing
alongside the canoe, and pulled it in and began to pick out the soft
eyes of it with her little golden scissors.

'Now,' said the Magician, 'make a Magic, Pau Amma, to show that you are
really important.'

Pau Amma rolled his eyes and waved his legs, but he could only stir up
the Sea, because, though he was a King Crab, he was nothing more than a
Crab, and the Eldest Magician laughed.

'You are not so important after all, Pau Amma,' he said. 'Now, let
me try,' and he made a Magic with his left hand--with just the little
finger of his left hand--and--lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau Amma's
hard, blue-green-black shell fell off him as a husk falls off a
cocoa-nut, and Pau Amma was left all soft--soft as the little crabs that
you sometimes find on the beach, Best Beloved.

'Indeed, you are very important,' said the Eldest Magician. 'Shall I ask
the Man here to cut you with kris? Shall I send for Raja Moyang Kaban,
the King of the Elephants, to pierce you with his tusks, or shall I call
Raja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, to bite you?'

And Pau Amma said, 'I am ashamed! Give me back my hard shell and let me
go back to Pusat Tasek, and I will only stir out once a day and once a
night to get my food.'

And the Eldest Magician said, 'No, Pau Amma, I will not give you back
your shell, for you will grow bigger and prouder and stronger, and
perhaps you will forget your promise, and you will play with the Sea
once more.

Then Pau Amma said, 'What shall I do? I am so big that I can only hide
in Pusat Tasek, and if I go anywhere else, all soft as I am now, the
sharks and the dogfish will eat me. And if I go to Pusat Tasek, all soft
as I am now, though I may be safe, I can never stir out to get my food,
and so I shall die.' Then he waved his legs and lamented.

'Listen, Pau Amma,' said the Eldest Magician. 'I cannot make you play
the play you were meant to play, because you escaped me at the Very
Beginning; but if you choose, I can make every stone and every hole and
every bunch of weed in all the seas a safe Pusat Tasek for you and your
children for always.'

Then Pau Amma said, 'That is good, but I do not choose yet. Look! there
is that Man who talked to you at the Very Beginning. If he had not taken
up your attention I should not have grown tired of waiting and run away,
and all this would never have happened. What will he do for me?'

And the Man said, 'If you choose, I will make a Magic, so that both
the deep water and the dry ground will be a home for you and your
children--so that you shall be able to hide both on the land and in the
sea.'

And Pau Amma said, 'I do not choose yet. Look! there is that girl who
saw me running away at the Very Beginning. If she had spoken then, the
Eldest Magician would have called me back, and all this would never have
happened. What will she do for me?'

And the little girl-daughter said, 'This is a good nut that I am eating.
If you choose, I will make a Magic and I will give you this pair of
scissors, very sharp and strong, so that you and your children can eat
cocoa-nuts like this all day long when you come up from the Sea to the
land; or you can dig a Pusat Tasek for yourself with the scissors that
belong to you when there is no stone or hole near by; and when the earth
is too hard, by the help of these same scissors you can run up a tree.'

And Pau Amma said, 'I do not choose yet, for, all soft as I am, these
gifts would not help me. Give me back my shell, O Eldest Magician, and
then I will play your play.'

And the Eldest Magician said, 'I will give it back, Pau Amma, for eleven
months of the year; but on the twelfth month of every year it shall grow
soft again, to remind you and all your children that I can make magics,
and to keep you humble, Pau Amma; for I see that if you can run both
under the water and on land, you will grow too bold; and if you can
climb trees and crack nuts and dig holes with your scissors, you will
grow too greedy, Pau Amma.'

Then Pau Amma thought a little and said, 'I have made my choice. I will
take all the gifts.'

Then the Eldest Magician made a Magic with the right hand, with all five
fingers of his right hand, and lo and behold, Best Beloved, Pau Amma
grew smaller and smaller and smaller, till at last there was only a
little green crab swimming in the water alongside the canoe, crying in a
very small voice, 'Give me the scissors!'

And the girl-daughter picked him up on the palm of her little brown
hand, and sat him in the bottom of the canoe and gave him her scissors,
and he waved them in his little arms, and opened them and shut them and
snapped them, and said, 'I can eat nuts. I can crack shells. I can dig
holes. I can climb trees. I can breathe in the dry air, and I can find
a safe Pusat Tasek under every stone. I did not know I was so important.
Kun?' (Is this right?)

'Payah-kun,' said the Eldest Magician, and he laughed and gave him his
blessing; and little Pau Amma scuttled over the side of the canoe into
the water; and he was so tiny that he could have hidden under the shadow
of a dry leaf on land or of a dead shell at the bottom of the sea.

'Was that well done?' said the Eldest Magician.

'Yes,' said the Man. 'But now we must go back to Perak, and that is
a weary way to paddle. If we had waited till Pau Amma had gone out of
Pusat Tasek and come home, the water would have carried us there by
itself.'

'You are lazy,' said the Eldest Magician. 'So your children shall be
lazy. They shall be the laziest people in the world. They shall be
called the Malazy--the lazy people;' and he held up his finger to the
Moon and said, 'O Fisherman, here is the Man too lazy to row home. Pull
his canoe home with your line, Fisherman.'

'No,' said the Man. 'If I am to be lazy all my days, let the Sea work
for me twice a day for ever. That will save paddling.'

And the Eldest Magician laughed and said, 'Payah kun' (That is right).

And the Rat of the Moon stopped biting the line; and the Fisherman let
his line down till it touched the Sea, and he pulled the whole deep Sea
along, past the Island of Bintang, past Singapore, past Malacca, past
Selangor, till the canoe whirled into the mouth of the Perak River
again. Kun?' said the Fisherman of the Moon.

'Payah kun,' said the Eldest Magician. 'See now that you pull the Sea
twice a day and twice a night for ever, so that the Malazy fishermen may
be saved paddling. But be careful not to do it too hard, or I shall make
a magic on you as I did to Pau Amma.'

Then they all went up the Perak River and went to bed, Best Beloved.

Now listen and attend!

From that day to this the Moon has always pulled the sea up and down
and made what we call the tides. Sometimes the Fisher of the Sea pulls a
little too hard, and then we get spring tides; and sometimes he pulls
a little too softly, and then we get what are called neap-tides; but
nearly always he is careful, because of the Eldest Magician.

And Pau Amma? You can see when you go to the beach, how all Pau Amma's
babies make little Pusat Taseks for themselves under every stone
and bunch of weed on the sands; you can see them waving their little
scissors; and in some parts of the world they truly live on the dry
land and run up the palm trees and eat cocoa-nuts, exactly as the
girl-daughter promised. But once a year all Pau Ammas must shake off
their hard armour and be soft-to remind them of what the Eldest Magician
could do. And so it isn't fair to kill or hunt Pau Amma's babies just
because old Pau Amma was stupidly rude a very long time ago.

Oh yes! And Pau Amma's babies hate being taken out of their little Pusat
Taseks and brought home in pickle-bottles. That is why they nip you with
their scissors, and it serves you right!


     CHINA-GOING P's and O's
     Pass Pau Amma's playground close,
     And his Pusat Tasek lies
     Near the track of most B.I.'s.
     U.Y.K. and N.D.L.
     Know Pau Amma's home as well
     As the fisher of the Sea knows
     'Bens,' M.M.'s, and Rubattinos.
     But (and this is rather queer)
     A.T.L.'s can not come here;
     O. and O. and D.O.A.
     Must go round another way.
     Orient, Anchor, Bibby, Hall,
     Never go that way at all.
     U.C.S. would have a fit
     If it found itself on it.
     And if 'Beavers' took their cargoes
     To Penang instead of Lagos,
     Or a fat Shaw-Savill bore
     Passengers to Singapore,
     Or a White Star were to try a
     Little trip to Sourabaya,
     Or a B.S.A. went on
     Past Natal to Cheribon,
     Then great Mr. Lloyds would come
     With a wire and drag them home!

     You'll know what my riddle means
     When you've eaten mangosteens.

Or if you can't wait till then, ask them to let you have the outside
page of the Times; turn over to page 2 where it is marked 'Shipping'
on the top left hand; then take the Atlas (and that is the finest
picture-book in the world) and see how the names of the places that
the steamers go to fit into the names of the places on the map. Any
steamer-kiddy ought to be able to do that; but if you can't read, ask
some one to show it you.




THE CAT THAT WALKED BY HIMSELF

HEAR and attend and listen; for this befell and behappened and became
and was, O my Best Beloved, when the Tame animals were wild. The Dog was
wild, and the Horse was wild, and the Cow was wild, and the Sheep was
wild, and the Pig was wild--as wild as wild could be--and they walked in
the Wet Wild Woods by their wild lones. But the wildest of all the wild
animals was the Cat. He walked by himself, and all places were alike to
him.

Of course the Man was wild too. He was dreadfully wild. He didn't even
begin to be tame till he met the Woman, and she told him that she
did not like living in his wild ways. She picked out a nice dry Cave,
instead of a heap of wet leaves, to lie down in; and she strewed clean
sand on the floor; and she lit a nice fire of wood at the back of
the Cave; and she hung a dried wild-horse skin, tail-down, across the
opening of the Cave; and she said, 'Wipe you feet, dear, when you come
in, and now we'll keep house.'

That night, Best Beloved, they ate wild sheep roasted on the hot stones,
and flavoured with wild garlic and wild pepper; and wild duck stuffed
with wild rice and wild fenugreek and wild coriander; and marrow-bones
of wild oxen; and wild cherries, and wild grenadillas. Then the Man
went to sleep in front of the fire ever so happy; but the Woman sat up,
combing her hair. She took the bone of the shoulder of mutton--the big
fat blade-bone--and she looked at the wonderful marks on it, and she
threw more wood on the fire, and she made a Magic. She made the First
Singing Magic in the world.

Out in the Wet Wild Woods all the wild animals gathered together where
they could see the light of the fire a long way off, and they wondered
what it meant.

Then Wild Horse stamped with his wild foot and said, 'O my Friends and O
my Enemies, why have the Man and the Woman made that great light in that
great Cave, and what harm will it do us?'

Wild Dog lifted up his wild nose and smelled the smell of roast mutton,
and said, 'I will go up and see and look, and say; for I think it is
good. Cat, come with me.'

'Nenni!' said the Cat. 'I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all
places are alike to me. I will not come.'

'Then we can never be friends again,' said Wild Dog, and he trotted off
to the Cave. But when he had gone a little way the Cat said to himself,
'All places are alike to me. Why should I not go too and see and look
and come away at my own liking.' So he slipped after Wild Dog softly,
very softly, and hid himself where he could hear everything.

When Wild Dog reached the mouth of the Cave he lifted up the dried
horse-skin with his nose and sniffed the beautiful smell of the roast
mutton, and the Woman, looking at the blade-bone, heard him, and
laughed, and said, 'Here comes the first. Wild Thing out of the Wild
Woods, what do you want?'

Wild Dog said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, what is this that
smells so good in the Wild Woods?'

Then the Woman picked up a roasted mutton-bone and threw it to Wild Dog,
and said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, taste and try.' Wild Dog
gnawed the bone, and it was more delicious than anything he had ever
tasted, and he said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, give me another.'

The Woman said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, help my Man to hunt
through the day and guard this Cave at night, and I will give you as
many roast bones as you need.'

'Ah!' said the Cat, listening. 'This is a very wise Woman, but she is
not so wise as I am.'

Wild Dog crawled into the Cave and laid his head on the Woman's lap, and
said, 'O my Friend and Wife of my Friend, I will help Your Man to hunt
through the day, and at night I will guard your Cave.'

'Ah!' said the Cat, listening. 'That is a very foolish Dog.' And he went
back through the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail, and walking by his
wild lone. But he never told anybody.

When the Man waked up he said, 'What is Wild Dog doing here?' And the
Woman said, 'His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the First Friend,
because he will be our friend for always and always and always. Take him
with you when you go hunting.'

Next night the Woman cut great green armfuls of fresh grass from the
water-meadows, and dried it before the fire, so that it smelt like
new-mown hay, and she sat at the mouth of the Cave and plaited a halter
out of horse-hide, and she looked at the shoulder of mutton-bone--at the
big broad blade-bone--and she made a Magic. She made the Second Singing
Magic in the world.

Out in the Wild Woods all the wild animals wondered what had happened to
Wild Dog, and at last Wild Horse stamped with his foot and said, 'I will
go and see and say why Wild Dog has not returned. Cat, come with me.'

'Nenni!' said the Cat. 'I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all
places are alike to me. I will not come.' But all the same he followed
Wild Horse softly, very softly, and hid himself where he could hear
everything.

When the Woman heard Wild Horse tripping and stumbling on his long mane,
she laughed and said, 'Here comes the second. Wild Thing out of the Wild
Woods what do you want?'

Wild Horse said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where is Wild Dog?'

The Woman laughed, and picked up the blade-bone and looked at it, and
said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, you did not come here for Wild
Dog, but for the sake of this good grass.'

And Wild Horse, tripping and stumbling on his long mane, said, 'That is
true; give it me to eat.'

The Woman said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, bend your wild head
and wear what I give you, and you shall eat the wonderful grass three
times a day.'

'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'this is a clever Woman, but she is not
so clever as I am.' Wild Horse bent his wild head, and the Woman slipped
the plaited hide halter over it, and Wild Horse breathed on the Woman's
feet and said, 'O my Mistress, and Wife of my Master, I will be your
servant for the sake of the wonderful grass.'

'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'that is a very foolish Horse.' And he
went back through the Wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail and walking
by his wild lone. But he never told anybody.

When the Man and the Dog came back from hunting, the Man said, 'What is
Wild Horse doing here?' And the Woman said, 'His name is not Wild Horse
any more, but the First Servant, because he will carry us from place
to place for always and always and always. Ride on his back when you go
hunting.

Next day, holding her wild head high that her wild horns should not
catch in the wild trees, Wild Cow came up to the Cave, and the Cat
followed, and hid himself just the same as before; and everything
happened just the same as before; and the Cat said the same things as
before, and when Wild Cow had promised to give her milk to the Woman
every day in exchange for the wonderful grass, the Cat went back through
the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone,
just the same as before. But he never told anybody. And when the Man
and the Horse and the Dog came home from hunting and asked the same
questions same as before, the Woman said, 'Her name is not Wild Cow any
more, but the Giver of Good Food. She will give us the warm white milk
for always and always and always, and I will take care of her while you
and the First Friend and the First Servant go hunting.

Next day the Cat waited to see if any other Wild thing would go up to
the Cave, but no one moved in the Wet Wild Woods, so the Cat walked
there by himself; and he saw the Woman milking the Cow, and he saw the
light of the fire in the Cave, and he smelt the smell of the warm white
milk.

Cat said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where did Wild Cow go?'

The Woman laughed and said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, go back
to the Woods again, for I have braided up my hair, and I have put away
the magic blade-bone, and we have no more need of either friends or
servants in our Cave.

Cat said, 'I am not a friend, and I am not a servant. I am the Cat who
walks by himself, and I wish to come into your cave.'

Woman said, 'Then why did you not come with First Friend on the first
night?'

Cat grew very angry and said, 'Has Wild Dog told tales of me?'

Then the Woman laughed and said, 'You are the Cat who walks by himself,
and all places are alike to you. Your are neither a friend nor a
servant. You have said it yourself. Go away and walk by yourself in all
places alike.'

Then Cat pretended to be sorry and said, 'Must I never come into the
Cave? Must I never sit by the warm fire? Must I never drink the warm
white milk? You are very wise and very beautiful. You should not be
cruel even to a Cat.'

Woman said, 'I knew I was wise, but I did not know I was beautiful. So I
will make a bargain with you. If ever I say one word in your praise you
may come into the Cave.'

'And if you say two words in my praise?' said the Cat.

'I never shall,' said the Woman, 'but if I say two words in your praise,
you may sit by the fire in the Cave.'

'And if you say three words?' said the Cat.

'I never shall,' said the Woman, 'but if I say three words in your
praise, you may drink the warm white milk three times a day for always
and always and always.'

Then the Cat arched his back and said, 'Now let the Curtain at the mouth
of the Cave, and the Fire at the back of the Cave, and the Milk-pots
that stand beside the Fire, remember what my Enemy and the Wife of my
Enemy has said.' And he went away through the Wet Wild Woods waving his
wild tail and walking by his wild lone.

That night when the Man and the Horse and the Dog came home from
hunting, the Woman did not tell them of the bargain that she had made
with the Cat, because she was afraid that they might not like it.

Cat went far and far away and hid himself in the Wet Wild Woods by his
wild lone for a long time till the Woman forgot all about him. Only the
Bat--the little upside-down Bat--that hung inside the Cave, knew where
Cat hid; and every evening Bat would fly to Cat with news of what was
happening.

One evening Bat said, 'There is a Baby in the Cave. He is new and pink
and fat and small, and the Woman is very fond of him.'

'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'but what is the Baby fond of?'

'He is fond of things that are soft and tickle,' said the Bat. 'He is
fond of warm things to hold in his arms when he goes to sleep. He is
fond of being played with. He is fond of all those things.'

'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'then my time has come.'

Next night Cat walked through the Wet Wild Woods and hid very near the
Cave till morning-time, and Man and Dog and Horse went hunting. The
Woman was busy cooking that morning, and the Baby cried and interrupted.
So she carried him outside the Cave and gave him a handful of pebbles to
play with. But still the Baby cried.

Then the Cat put out his paddy paw and patted the Baby on the cheek, and
it cooed; and the Cat rubbed against its fat knees and tickled it under
its fat chin with his tail. And the Baby laughed; and the Woman heard
him and smiled.

Then the Bat--the little upside-down bat--that hung in the mouth of the
Cave said, 'O my Hostess and Wife of my Host and Mother of my Host's
Son, a Wild Thing from the Wild Woods is most beautifully playing with
your Baby.'

'A blessing on that Wild Thing whoever he may be,' said the Woman,
straightening her back, 'for I was a busy woman this morning and he has
done me a service.'

That very minute and second, Best Beloved, the dried horse-skin
Curtain that was stretched tail-down at the mouth of the Cave fell
down--whoosh!--because it remembered the bargain she had made with the
Cat, and when the Woman went to pick it up--lo and behold!--the Cat was
sitting quite comfy inside the Cave.

'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,' said the Cat,
'it is I: for you have spoken a word in my praise, and now I can sit
within the Cave for always and always and always. But still I am the Cat
who walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.'

The Woman was very angry, and shut her lips tight and took up her
spinning-wheel and began to spin. But the Baby cried because the Cat had
gone away, and the Woman could not hush it, for it struggled and kicked
and grew black in the face.

'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,' said the Cat,
'take a strand of the wire that you are spinning and tie it to your
spinning-whorl and drag it along the floor, and I will show you a magic
that shall make your Baby laugh as loudly as he is now crying.'

'I will do so,' said the Woman, 'because I am at my wits' end; but I
will not thank you for it.'

She tied the thread to the little clay spindle whorl and drew it across
the floor, and the Cat ran after it and patted it with his paws and
rolled head over heels, and tossed it backward over his shoulder and
chased it between his hind-legs and pretended to lose it, and pounced
down upon it again, till the Baby laughed as loudly as it had been
crying, and scrambled after the Cat and frolicked all over the Cave till
it grew tired and settled down to sleep with the Cat in its arms.

'Now,' said the Cat, 'I will sing the Baby a song that shall keep him
asleep for an hour. And he began to purr, loud and low, low and loud,
till the Baby fell fast asleep. The Woman smiled as she looked down upon
the two of them and said, 'That was wonderfully done. No question but
you are very clever, O Cat.'

That very minute and second, Best Beloved, the smoke of the fire at the
back of the Cave came down in clouds from the roof--puff!--because
it remembered the bargain she had made with the Cat, and when it had
cleared away--lo and behold!--the Cat was sitting quite comfy close to
the fire.

'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of My Enemy,' said the Cat,
'it is I, for you have spoken a second word in my praise, and now I can
sit by the warm fire at the back of the Cave for always and always and
always. But still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are
alike to me.'

Then the Woman was very very angry, and let down her hair and put more
wood on the fire and brought out the broad blade-bone of the shoulder of
mutton and began to make a Magic that should prevent her from saying
a third word in praise of the Cat. It was not a Singing Magic, Best
Beloved, it was a Still Magic; and by and by the Cave grew so still that
a little wee-wee mouse crept out of a corner and ran across the floor.

'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy,' said the Cat,
'is that little mouse part of your magic?'

'Ouh! Chee! No indeed!' said the Woman, and she dropped the blade-bone
and jumped upon the footstool in front of the fire and braided up her
hair very quick for fear that the mouse should run up it.

'Ah,' said the Cat, watching, 'then the mouse will do me no harm if I
eat it?'

'No,' said the Woman, braiding up her hair, 'eat it quickly and I will
ever be grateful to you.'

Cat made one jump and caught the little mouse, and the Woman said,
'A hundred thanks. Even the First Friend is not quick enough to catch
little mice as you have done. You must be very wise.'

That very moment and second, O Best Beloved, the Milk-pot that stood by
the fire cracked in two pieces--ffft--because it remembered the bargain
she had made with the Cat, and when the Woman jumped down from the
footstool--lo and behold!--the Cat was lapping up the warm white milk
that lay in one of the broken pieces.

'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy and Mother of my Enemy, said the Cat,
'it is I; for you have spoken three words in my praise, and now I can
drink the warm white milk three times a day for always and always and
always. But still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are
alike to me.'

Then the Woman laughed and set the Cat a bowl of the warm white milk and
said, 'O Cat, you are as clever as a man, but remember that your bargain
was not made with the Man or the Dog, and I do not know what they will
do when they come home.'

'What is that to me?' said the Cat. 'If I have my place in the Cave by
the fire and my warm white milk three times a day I do not care what the
Man or the Dog can do.'

That evening when the Man and the Dog came into the Cave, the Woman
told them all the story of the bargain while the Cat sat by the fire and
smiled. Then the Man said, 'Yes, but he has not made a bargain with me
or with all proper Men after me.' Then he took off his two leather boots
and he took up his little stone axe (that makes three) and he fetched a
piece of wood and a hatchet (that is five altogether), and he set them
out in a row and he said, 'Now we will make our bargain. If you do not
catch mice when you are in the Cave for always and always and always, I
will throw these five things at you whenever I see you, and so shall all
proper Men do after me.'

'Ah,' said the Woman, listening, 'this is a very clever Cat, but he is
not so clever as my Man.'

The Cat counted the five things (and they looked very knobby) and he
said, 'I will catch mice when I am in the Cave for always and always and
always; but still I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all places are
alike to me.'

'Not when I am near,' said the Man. 'If you had not said that last I
would have put all these things away for always and always and always;
but I am now going to throw my two boots and my little stone axe (that
makes three) at you whenever I meet you. And so shall all proper Men do
after me!'

Then the Dog said, 'Wait a minute. He has not made a bargain with me or
with all proper Dogs after me.' And he showed his teeth and said, 'If
you are not kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave for always and
always and always, I will hunt you till I catch you, and when I catch
you I will bite you. And so shall all proper Dogs do after me.'

'Ah,' said the Woman, listening, 'this is a very clever Cat, but he is
not so clever as the Dog.'

Cat counted the Dog's teeth (and they looked very pointed) and he said,
'I will be kind to the Baby while I am in the Cave, as long as he does
not pull my tail too hard, for always and always and always. But still I
am the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are alike to me.'

'Not when I am near,' said the Dog. 'If you had not said that last I
would have shut my mouth for always and always and always; but now I am
going to hunt you up a tree whenever I meet you. And so shall all proper
Dogs do after me.'

Then the Man threw his two boots and his little stone axe (that makes
three) at the Cat, and the Cat ran out of the Cave and the Dog chased
him up a tree; and from that day to this, Best Beloved, three proper Men
out of five will always throw things at a Cat whenever they meet him,
and all proper Dogs will chase him up a tree. But the Cat keeps his side
of the bargain too. He will kill mice and he will be kind to Babies when
he is in the house, just as long as they do not pull his tail too hard.
But when he has done that, and between times, and when the moon gets up
and night comes, he is the Cat that walks by himself, and all places are
alike to him. Then he goes out to the Wet Wild Woods or up the Wet Wild
Trees or on the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his wild tail and walking by his
wild lone.


     PUSSY can sit by the fire and sing,
       Pussy can climb a tree,
     Or play with a silly old cork and string
       To'muse herself, not me.
     But I like Binkie my dog, because
       He Lnows how to behave;
     So, Binkie's the same as the First Friend was,
       And I am the Man in the Cave.

     Pussy will play man-Friday till
       It's time to wet her paw
     And make her walk on the window-sill
       (For the footprint Crusoe saw);
     Then she fluffles her tail and mews,
       And scratches and won't attend.
     But Binkie will play whatever I choose,
       And he is my true First Friend.

     Pussy will rub my knees with her head
       Pretending she loves me hard;
     But the very minute I go to my bed
       Pussy runs out in the yard,
     And there she stays till the morning-light;
       So I know it is only pretend;
     But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,
       And he is my Firstest Friend!




THE BUTTERFLY THAT STAMPED

THIS, O my Best Beloved, is a story--a new and a wonderful story--a
story quite different from the other stories--a story about The Most
Wise Sovereign Suleiman-bin-Daoud--Solomon the Son of David.

There are three hundred and fifty-five stories about Suleiman-bin-Daoud;
but this is not one of them. It is not the story of the Lapwing who
found the Water; or the Hoopoe who shaded Suleimanbin-Daoud from the
heat. It is not the story of the Glass Pavement, or the Ruby with
the Crooked Hole, or the Gold Bars of Balkis. It is the story of the
Butterfly that Stamped.

Now attend all over again and listen!

Suleiman-bin-Daoud was wise. He understood what the beasts said, what
the birds said, what the fishes said, and what the insects said. He
understood what the rocks said deep under the earth when they bowed in
towards each other and groaned; and he understood what the trees
said when they rustled in the middle of the morning. He understood
everything, from the bishop on the bench to the hyssop on the wall, and
Balkis, his Head Queen, the Most Beautiful Queen Balkis, was nearly as
wise as he was.

Suleiman-bin-Daoud was strong. Upon the third finger of the right hand
he wore a ring. When he turned it once, Afrits and Djinns came Out of
the earth to do whatever he told them. When he turned it twice, Fairies
came down from the sky to do whatever he told them; and when he turned
it three times, the very great angel Azrael of the Sword came dressed
as a water-carrier, and told him the news of the three worlds,
Above--Below--and Here.

And yet Suleiman-bin-Daoud was not proud. He very seldom showed off, and
when he did he was sorry for it. Once he tried to feed all the animals
in all the world in one day, but when the food was ready an Animal came
out of the deep sea and ate it up in three mouthfuls. Suleiman-bin-Daoud
was very surprised and said, 'O Animal, who are you?' And the Animal
said, 'O King, live for ever! I am the smallest of thirty thousand
brothers, and our home is at the bottom of the sea. We heard that you
were going to feed all the animals in all the world, and my brothers
sent me to ask when dinner would be ready.' Suleiman-bin-Daoud was more
surprised than ever and said, 'O Animal, you have eaten all the dinner
that I made ready for all the animals in the world.' And the Animal
said, 'O King, live for ever, but do you really call that a dinner?
Where I come from we each eat twice as much as that between meals.' Then
Suleiman-bin-Daoud fell flat on his face and said, 'O Animal! I gave
that dinner to show what a great and rich king I was, and not because I
really wanted to be kind to the animals. Now I am ashamed, and it serves
me right. Suleiman-bin-Daoud was a really truly wise man, Best Beloved.
After that he never forgot that it was silly to show off; and now the
real story part of my story begins.

He married ever so many wifes. He married nine hundred and ninety-nine
wives, besides the Most Beautiful Balkis; and they all lived in a great
golden palace in the middle of a lovely garden with fountains. He
didn't really want nine-hundred and ninety-nine wives, but in those
days everybody married ever so many wives, and of course the King had to
marry ever so many more just to show that he was the King.

Some of the wives were nice, but some were simply horrid, and the horrid
ones quarrelled with the nice ones and made them horrid too, and then
they would all quarrel with Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and that was horrid
for him. But Balkis the Most Beautiful never quarrelled with
Suleiman-bin-Daoud. She loved him too much. She sat in her rooms in the
Golden Palace, or walked in the Palace garden, and was truly sorry for
him.

Of course if he had chosen to turn his ring on his finger and call
up the Djinns and the Afrits they would have magicked all those nine
hundred and ninety-nine quarrelsome wives into white mules of the desert
or greyhounds or pomegranate seeds; but Suleiman-bin-Daoud thought that
that would be showing off. So, when they quarrelled too much, he only
walked by himself in one part of the beautiful Palace gardens and wished
he had never been born.

One day, when they had quarrelled for three weeks--all nine hundred and
ninety-nine wives together--Suleiman-bin-Daoud went out for peace
and quiet as usual; and among the orange trees he met Balkis the Most
Beautiful, very sorrowful because Suleiman-bin-Daoud was so worried.
And she said to him, 'O my Lord and Light of my Eyes, turn the ring upon
your finger and show these Queens of Egypt and Mesopotamia and
Persia and China that you are the great and terrible King.' But
Suleiman-bin-Daoud shook his head and said, 'O my Lady and Delight of my
Life, remember the Animal that came out of the sea and made me ashamed
before all the animals in all the world because I showed off. Now, if
I showed off before these Queens of Persia and Egypt and Abyssinia and
China, merely because they worry me, I might be made even more ashamed
than I have been.'

And Balkis the Most Beautiful said, 'O my Lord and Treasure of my Soul,
what will you do?'

And Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, 'O my Lady and Content of my Heart, I
shall continue to endure my fate at the hands of these nine hundred and
ninety-nine Queens who vex me with their continual quarrelling.'

So he went on between the lilies and the loquats and the roses and the
cannas and the heavy-scented ginger-plants that grew in the garden, till
he came to the great camphor-tree that was called the Camphor Tree of
Suleiman-bin-Daoud. But Balkis hid among the tall irises and the spotted
bamboos and the red lillies behind the camphor-tree, so as to be near
her own true love, Suleiman-bin-Daoud.

Presently two Butterflies flew under the tree, quarrelling.

Suleiman-bin-Daoud heard one say to the other, 'I wonder at your
presumption in talking like this to me. Don't you know that if I stamped
with my foot all Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Palace and this garden here would
immediately vanish in a clap of thunder.'

Then Suleiman-bin-Daoud forgot his nine hundred and ninety-nine
bothersome wives, and laughed, till the camphor-tree shook, at the
Butterfly's boast. And he held out his finger and said, 'Little man,
come here.'

The Butterfly was dreadfully frightened, but he managed to fly up to
the hand of Suleiman-bin-Daoud, and clung there, fanning himself.
Suleiman-bin-Daoud bent his head and whispered very softly, 'Little man,
you know that all your stamping wouldn't bend one blade of grass. What
made you tell that awful fib to your wife?--for doubtless she is your
wife.'

The Butterfly looked at Suleiman-bin-Daoud and saw the most wise King's
eye twinkle like stars on a frosty night, and he picked up his courage
with both wings, and he put his head on one side and said, 'O King, live
for ever. She is my wife; and you know what wives are like.

Suleiman-bin-Daoud smiled in his beard and said, 'Yes, I know, little
brother.

'One must keep them in order somehow, said the Butterfly, and she has
been quarrelling with me all the morning. I said that to quiet her.'

And Suleiman-bin-Daoud said, 'May it quiet her. Go back to your wife,
little brother, and let me hear what you say.'

Back flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was all of a twitter behind
a leaf, and she said, 'He heard you! Suleiman-bin-Daoud himself heard
you!'

'Heard me!' said the Butterfly. 'Of course he did. I meant him to hear
me.'

'And what did he say? Oh, what did he say?'

'Well,' said the Butterfly, fanning himself most importantly, 'between
you and me, my dear--of course I don't blame him, because his Palace
must have cost a great deal and the oranges are just ripening,--he asked
me not to stamp, and I promised I wouldn't.'

'Gracious!' said his wife, and sat quite quiet; but Suleiman-bin-Daoud
laughed till the tears ran down his face at the impudence of the bad
little Butterfly.

Balkis the Most Beautiful stood up behind the tree among the red lilies
and smiled to herself, for she had heard all this talk. She thought,
'If I am wise I can yet save my Lord from the persecutions of these
quarrelsome Queens,' and she held out her finger and whispered softly to
the Butterfly's Wife, 'Little woman, come here.' Up flew the Butterfly's
Wife, very frightened, and clung to Balkis's white hand.

Balkis bent her beautiful head down and whispered, 'Little woman, do you
believe what your husband has just said?'

The Butterfly's Wife looked at Balkis, and saw the most beautiful
Queen's eyes shining like deep pools with starlight on them, and she
picked up her courage with both wings and said, 'O Queen, be lovely for
ever. You know what men-folk are like.'

And the Queen Balkis, the Wise Balkis of Sheba, put her hand to her lips
to hide a smile and said, 'Little sister, I know.'

'They get angry,' said the Butterfly's Wife, fanning herself quickly,
'over nothing at all, but we must humour them, O Queen. They never mean
half they say. If it pleases my husband to believe that I believe he
can make Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Palace disappear by stamping his foot, I'm
sure I don't care. He'll forget all about it to-morrow.'

'Little sister,' said Balkis, 'you are quite right; but next time he
begins to boast, take him at his word. Ask him to stamp, and see what
will happen. We know what men-folk are like, don't we? He'll be very
much ashamed.'

Away flew the Butterfly's Wife to her husband, and in five minutes they
were quarrelling worse than ever.

'Remember!' said the Butterfly. 'Remember what I can do if I stamp my
foot.'

'I don't believe you one little bit,' said the Butterfly's Wife. 'I
should very much like to see it done. Suppose you stamp now.'

'I promised Suleiman-bin-Daoud that I wouldn't,' said the Butterfly,
'and I don't want to break my promise.'

'It wouldn't matter if you did,' said his wife. 'You couldn't bend
a blade of grass with your stamping. I dare you to do it,' she said.
Stamp! Stamp! Stamp!'

Suleiman-bin-Daoud, sitting under the camphor-tree, heard every word
of this, and he laughed as he had never laughed in his life before. He
forgot all about his Queens; he forgot all about the Animal that came
out of the sea; he forgot about showing off. He just laughed with joy,
and Balkis, on the other side of the tree, smiled because her own true
love was so joyful.

Presently the Butterfly, very hot and puffy, came whirling back under
the shadow of the camphor-tree and said to Suleiman, 'She wants me to
stamp! She wants to see what will happen, O Suleiman-bin-Daoud! You know
I can't do it, and now she'll never believe a word I say. She'll laugh
at me to the end of my days!'

'No, little brother,' said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, 'she will never laugh at
you again,' and he turned the ring on his finger--just for the little
Butterfly's sake, not for the sake of showing off,--and, lo and behold,
four huge Djinns came out of the earth!

'Slaves,' said Suleiman-bin-Daoud, 'when this gentleman on my finger'
(that was where the impudent Butterfly was sitting) 'stamps his left
front forefoot you will make my Palace and these gardens disappear in
a clap of thunder. When he stamps again you will bring them back
carefully.'

'Now, little brother,' he said, 'go back to your wife and stamp all
you've a mind to.'

Away flew the Butterfly to his wife, who was crying, 'I dare you to do
it! I dare you to do it! Stamp! Stamp now! Stamp!' Balkis saw the four
vast Djinns stoop down to the four corners of the gardens with the
Palace in the middle, and she clapped her hands softly and said, 'At
last Suleiman-bin-Daoud will do for the sake of a Butterfly what he
ought to have done long ago for his own sake, and the quarrelsome Queens
will be frightened!'

The the butterfly stamped. The Djinns jerked the Palace and the gardens
a thousand miles into the air: there was a most awful thunder-clap, and
everything grew inky-black. The Butterfly's Wife fluttered about in the
dark, crying, 'Oh, I'll be good! I'm so sorry I spoke. Only bring the
gardens back, my dear darling husband, and I'll never contradict again.'

The Butterfly was nearly as frightened as his wife, and
Suleiman-bin-Daoud laughed so much that it was several minutes before
he found breath enough to whisper to the Butterfly, 'Stamp again, little
brother. Give me back my Palace, most great magician.'

'Yes, give him back his Palace,' said the Butterfly's Wife, still flying
about in the dark like a moth. 'Give him back his Palace, and don't
let's have any more horrid.magic.'

'Well, my dear,' said the Butterfly as bravely as he could, 'you see
what your nagging has led to. Of course it doesn't make any difference
to me--I'm used to this kind of thing--but as a favour to you and to
Suleiman-bin-Daoud I don't mind putting things right.'

So he stamped once more, and that instant the Djinns let down the Palace
and the gardens, without even a bump. The sun shone on the dark-green
orange leaves; the fountains played among the pink Egyptian lilies; the
birds went on singing, and the Butterfly's Wife lay on her side under
the camphor-tree waggling her wings and panting, 'Oh, I'll be good! I'll
be good!'

Suleiman-bin-Daolld could hardly speak for laughing. He leaned back all
weak and hiccoughy, and shook his finger at the Butterfly and said, 'O
great wizard, what is the sense of returning to me my Palace if at the
same time you slay me with mirth!'

Then came a terrible noise, for all the nine hundred and ninety-nine
Queens ran out of the Palace shrieking and shouting and calling for
their babies. They hurried down the great marble steps below the
fountain, one hundred abreast, and the Most Wise Balkis went statelily
forward to meet them and said, 'What is your trouble, O Queens?'

They stood on the marble steps one hundred abreast and shouted, 'What is
our trouble? We were living peacefully in our golden palace, as is our
custom, when upon a sudden the Palace disappeared, and we were left
sitting in a thick and noisome darkness; and it thundered, and Djinns
and Afrits moved about in the darkness! That is our trouble, O Head
Queen, and we are most extremely troubled on account of that trouble,
for it was a troublesome trouble, unlike any trouble we have known.'

Then Balkis the Most Beautiful Queen--Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Very Best
Beloved--Queen that was of Sheba and Sable and the Rivers of the Gold
of the South--from the Desert of Zinn to the Towers of Zimbabwe--Balkis,
almost as wise as the Most Wise Suleiman-bin-Daoud himself, said, 'It
is nothing, O Queens! A Butterfly has made complaint against his
wife because she quarrelled with him, and it has pleased our Lord
Suleiman-bin-Daoud to teach her a lesson in low-speaking and humbleness,
for that is counted a virtue among the wives of the butterflies.'

Then up and spoke an Egyptian Queen--the daughter of a Pharoah--and she
said, 'Our Palace cannot be plucked up by the roots like a leek for the
sake of a little insect. No! Suleiman-bin-Daoud must be dead, and what
we heard and saw was the earth thundering and darkening at the news.'

Then Balkis beckoned that bold Queen without looking at her, and said to
her and to the others, 'Come and see.'

They came down the marble steps, one hundred abreast, and beneath his
camphor-tree, still weak with laughing, they saw the Most Wise King
Suleiman-bin-Daoud rocking back and forth with a Butterfly on either
hand, and they heard him say, 'O wife of my brother in the air, remember
after this, to please your husband in all things, lest he be provoked to
stamp his foot yet again; for he has said that he is used to this magic,
and he is most eminently a great magician--one who steals away the very
Palace of Suleirnan-bin-Daoud himself. Go in peace, little folk!' And he
kissed them on the wings, and they flew away.

Then all the Queens except Balkis--the Most Beautiful and Splendid
Balkis, who stood apart smiling--fell flat on their faces, for they
said, 'If these things are done when a Butterfly is displeased with
his wife, what shall be done to us who have vexed our King with our
loud-speaking and open quarrelling through many days?'

Then they put their veils over their heads, and they put their hands
over their mouths, and they tiptoed back to the Palace most mousy-quiet.

Then Balkis--The Most Beautiful and Excellent Balkis--went forward
through the red lilies into the shade of the camphor-tree and laid
her hand upon Suleiman-bin-Daoud's shoulder and said, 'O my Lord and
Treasure of my Soul, rejoice, for we have taught the Queens of Egypt and
Ethiopia and Abyssinia and Persia and India and China with a great and a
memorable teaching.'

And Suleiman-bin-Daoud, still looking after the Butterflies where they
played in the sunlight, said, 'O my Lady and Jewel of my Felicity, when
did this happen? For I have been jesting with a Butterfly ever since I
came into the garden.' And he told Balkis what he had done.

Balkis--The tender and Most Lovely Balkis--said, 'O my Lord and Regent
of my Existence, I hid behind the camphor-tree and saw it all. It was I
who told the Butterfly's Wife to ask the Butterfly to stamp, because I
hoped that for the sake of the jest my Lord would make some great magic
and that the Queens would see it and be frightened.' And she told him
what the Queens had said and seen and thought.

Then Suleiman-bin-Daoud rose up from his seat under the camphor-tree,
and stretched his arms and rejoiced and said, 'O my Lady and Sweetener
of my Days, know that if I had made a magic against my Queens for the
sake of pride or anger, as I made that feast for all the animals, I
should certainly have been put to shame. But by means of your wisdom
I made the magic for the sake of a jest and for the sake of a little
Butterfly, and--behold--it has also delivered me from the vexations of
my vexatious wives! Tell me, therefore, O my Lady and Heart of my Heart,
how did you come to be so wise?' And Balkis the Queen, beautiful and
tall, looked up into Suleiman-bin-Daoud's eyes and put her head a little
on one side, just like the Butterfly, and said, 'First, O my Lord,
because I loved you; and secondly, O my Lord, because I know what
women-folk are.'

Then they went up to the Palace and lived happily ever afterwards.

But wasn't it clever of Balkis?


     THERE was never a Queen like Balkis,
       From here to the wide world's end;
     But Balkis tailed to a butterfly
       As you would talk to a friend.

     There was never a King like Solomon,
       Not since the world began;
     But Solomon talked to a butterfly
       As a man would talk to a man.

     She was Queen of Sabaea--
       And he was Asia's Lord--
     But they both of 'em talked to butterflies
       When they took their walks abroad!

Chapter 1


  O ye who tread the Narrow Way
  By Tophet-flare to Judgment Day,
  Be gentle when 'the heathen' pray
  To Buddha at Kamakura!

  Buddha at Kamakura.


He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam Zammah on
her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher--the Wonder House, as
the natives call the Lahore Museum. Who hold Zam-Zammah, that
'fire-breathing dragon', hold the Punjab, for the great green-bronze
piece is always first of the conqueror's loot.

There was some justification for Kim--he had kicked Lala Dinanath's boy
off the trunnions--since the English held the Punjab and Kim was
English.  Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the
vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain
sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the
small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very
poorest.  The half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium,
and pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square where
the cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she was Kim's mother's
sister; but his mother had been nursemaid in a Colonel's family and had
married Kimball O'Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an
Irish regiment.  He afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and
Delhi Railway, and his Regiment went home without him.  The wife died
of cholera in Ferozepore, and O'Hara fell to drink and loafing up and
down the line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby.  Societies and
chaplains, anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O'Hara
drifted away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned
the taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India.  His estate
at death consisted of three papers--one he called his 'ne varietur'
because those words were written below his signature thereon, and
another his 'clearance-certificate'.  The third was Kim's
birth-certificate.  Those things, he was used to say, in his glorious
opium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man.  On no account was
Kim to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of
magic--such magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in
the big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher--the Magic House, as we name the
Masonic Lodge.  It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim's
horn would be exalted between pillars--monstrous pillars--of beauty and
strength.  The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the
finest Regiment in the world, would attend to Kim--little Kim that
should have been better off than his father.  Nine hundred first-class
devils, whose God was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim,
if they had not forgotten O'Hara--poor O'Hara that was gang-foreman on
the Ferozepore line.  Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush
chair on the veranda.  So it came about after his death that the woman
sewed parchment, paper, and birth-certificate into a leather
amulet-case which she strung round Kim's neck.

'And some day,' she said, confusedly remembering O'Hara's prophecies,
'there will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the
Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and' dropping into
English--'nine hundred devils.'

'Ah,' said Kim, 'I shall remember.  A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse
will come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making
ready the ground for these matters.  That is how my father said they
always did; and it is always so when men work magic.'

If the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers,
he would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and
sent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of
magic she distrusted.  Kim, too, held views of his own.  As he reached
the years of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white
men of serious aspect who asked who he was, and what he did.  For Kim
did nothing with an immense success.  True, he knew the wonderful
walled city of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was
hand in glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun al
Raschid dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian
Nights, but missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could
not see the beauty of it.  His nickname through the wards was 'Little
Friend of all the World'; and very often, being lithe and
inconspicuous, he executed commissions by night on the crowded
housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion.  It was
intrigue,--of course he knew that much, as he had known all evil since
he could speak,--but what he loved was the game for its own sake--the
stealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes, the crawl up a
waterpipe, the sights and sounds of the women's world on the flat
roofs, and the headlong flight from housetop to housetop under cover of
the hot dark. Then there were holy men, ash-smeared fakirs by their
brick shrines under the trees at the riverside, with whom he was quite
familiar--greeting them as they returned from begging-tours, and, when
no one was by, eating from the same dish.  The woman who looked after
him insisted with tears that he should wear European clothes--trousers,
a shirt and a battered hat.  Kim found it easier to slip into Hindu or
Mohammedan garb when engaged on certain businesses.  One of the young
men of fashion--he who was found dead at the bottom of a well on the
night of the earthquake--had once given him a complete suit of Hindu
kit, the costume of a lowcaste street boy, and Kim stored it in a
secret place under some baulks in Nila Ram's timber-yard, beyond the
Punjab High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after
they have driven down the Ravi.  When there was business or frolic
afoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to the veranda,
all tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or
yelling at a Hindu festival.  Sometimes there was food in the house,
more often there was not, and then Kim went out again to eat with his
native friends.

As he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from
his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the
sweetmeat-seller's son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman
on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned
tolerantly:  he knew Kim of old.  So did the water-carrier, sluicing
water on the dry road from his goat-skin bag.  So did Jawahir Singh,
the Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases.  So did everybody in
sight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder
House to view the things that men made in their own province and
elsewhere.  The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures,
and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.

'Off!  Off!  Let me up!' cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam-Zammah's wheel.

'Thy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the ghi,' sang Kim.
'All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!'

'Let me up!' shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered cap.
His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is the
only democratic land in the world.

'The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too.  The Mussalmans pushed them off.
Thy father was a pastry-cook--'

He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee
Bazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never
seen.  He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy
stuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to
any known trade or profession.  At his belt hung a long open-work iron
pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear.  On his head was a
gigantic sort of tam-o'-shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like
that of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar.  His eyes
turned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.

'Who is that?' said Kim to his companions.

'Perhaps it is a man,' said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.

'Without doubt,' returned Kim; 'but he is no man of India that I have
ever seen.'

'A priest, perhaps,' said Chota Lal, spying the rosary.  'See!  He goes
into the Wonder House!'

'Nay, nay,' said the policeman, shaking his head.  'I do not understand
your talk.'  The constable spoke Punjabi.  'O Friend of all the World,
what does he say?'

'Send him hither,' said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his
bare heels.  'He is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.'

The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys.  He was old,
and his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the
mountain passes.

'O Children, what is that big house?' he said in very fair Urdu.

'The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!'  Kim gave him no title--such as
Lala or Mian.  He could not divine the man's creed.

'Ah!  The Wonder House!  Can any enter?'

'It is written above the door--all can enter.'

'Without payment?'

'I go in and out.  I am no banker,' laughed Kim.

'Alas!  I am an old man.  I did not know.'  Then, fingering his rosary,
he half turned to the Museum.

'What is your caste?  Where is your house?  Have you come far?'  Kim
asked.

'I came by Kulu--from beyond the Kailas--but what know you? From the
Hills where'--he sighed--'the air and water are fresh and cool.'

'Aha!  Khitai [a Chinaman],' said Abdullah proudly.  Fook Shing had
once chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the
boots.

'Pahari [a hillman],' said little Chota Lal.

'Aye, child--a hillman from hills thou'lt never see.  Didst hear of
Bhotiyal [Tibet]?  I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya [Tibetan], since you
must know--a lama--or, say, a guru in your tongue.'

'A guru from Tibet,' said Kim.  'I have not seen such a man.  They be
Hindus in Tibet, then?'

'We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries,
and I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are
children, know as much as I do who am old.' He smiled benignantly on
the boys.

'Hast thou eaten?'

He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn, wooden begging-bowl. The
boys nodded.  All priests of their acquaintance begged.

'I do not wish to eat yet.'  He turned his head like an old tortoise in
the sunlight.  'Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder
House of Lahore?'  He repeated the last words as one making sure of an
address.

'That is true,' said Abdullah.  'It is full of heathen busts.  Thou
also art an idolater.'

'Never mind him,' said.  Kim.  'That is the Government's house and
there is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white beard. Come
with me and I will show.'

'Strange priests eat boys,' whispered Chota Lal.

'And he is a stranger and a but-parast [idolater],' said Abdullah, the
Mohammedan.

Kim laughed.  'He is new.  Run to your mothers' laps, and be safe.
Come!'

Kim clicked round the self-registering turnstile; the old man followed
and halted amazed.  In the entrance-hall stood the larger figures of
the Greco-Buddhist sculptures done, savants know how long since, by
forgotten workmen whose hands were feeling, and not unskilfully, for
the mysteriously transmitted Grecian touch. There were hundreds of
pieces, friezes of figures in relief, fragments of statues and slabs
crowded with figures that had encrusted the brick walls of the Buddhist
stupas and viharas of the North Country and now, dug up and labelled,
made the pride of the Museum.  In open-mouthed wonder the lama turned
to this and that, and finally checked in rapt attention before a large
alto-relief representing a coronation or apotheosis of the Lord Buddha.
The Master was represented seated on a lotus the petals of which were
so deeply undercut as to show almost detached. Round Him was an adoring
hierarchy of kings, elders, and old-time Buddhas.  Below were
lotus-covered waters with fishes and water-birds.  Two butterfly-winged
devas held a wreath over His head; above them another pair supported an
umbrella surmounted by the jewelled headdress of the Bodhisat.

'The Lord!  The Lord!  It is Sakya Muni himself,' the lama half sobbed;
and under his breath began the wonderful Buddhist invocation:

To Him the Way, the Law, apart, Whom Maya held beneath her heart,
Ananda's Lord, the Bodhisat.

'And He is here!  The Most Excellent Law is here also.  My pilgrimage
is well begun.  And what work!  What work!'

'Yonder is the Sahib.'  said Kim, and dodged sideways among the cases
of the arts and manufacturers wing.  A white-bearded Englishman was
looking at the lama, who gravely turned and saluted him and after some
fumbling drew forth a note-book and a scrap of paper.

'Yes, that is my name,' smiling at the clumsy, childish print.

'One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places--he is now Abbot
of the Lung-Cho Monastery--gave it me,' stammered the lama.  'He spoke
of these.'  His lean hand moved tremulously round.

'Welcome, then, O lama from Tibet.  Here be the images, and I am
here'--he glanced at the lama's face--'to gather knowledge. Come to my
office awhile.'  The old man was trembling with excitement.

The office was but a little wooden cubicle partitioned off from the
sculpture-lined gallery.  Kim laid himself down, his ear against a
crack in the heat-split cedar door, and, following his instinct,
stretched out to listen and watch.

Most of the talk was altogether above his head.  The lama, haltingly at
first, spoke to the Curator of his own lamassery, the Such-zen,
opposite the Painted Rocks, four months' march away.  The Curator
brought out a huge book of photos and showed him that very place,
perched on its crag, overlooking the gigantic valley of many-hued
strata.

'Ay, ay!'  The lama mounted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles of Chinese
work.  'Here is the little door through which we bring wood before
winter.  And thou--the English know of these things? He who is now
Abbot of Lung-Cho told me, but I did not believe. The Lord--the
Excellent One--He has honour here too?  And His life is known?'

'It is all carven upon the stones.  Come and see, if thou art rested.'

Out shuffled the lama to the main hall, and, the Curator beside him,
went through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the
appreciative instinct of a craftsman.

Incident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the
blurred stone, puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek
convention, but delighted as a child at each new trove.  Where the
sequence failed, as in the Annunciation, the Curator supplied it from
his mound of books--French and German, with photographs and
reproductions.

Here was the devout Asita, the pendant of Simeon in the Christian
story, holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father
listened; and here were incidents in the legend of the cousin
Devadatta.  Here was the wicked woman who accused the Master of
impurity, all confounded; here was the teaching in the Deer-park; the
miracle that stunned the fire-worshippers; here was the Bodhisat in
royal state as a prince; the miraculous birth; the death at Kusinagara,
where the weak disciple fainted; while there were almost countless
repetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree; and the adoration
of the alms-bowl was everywhere.  In a few minutes the Curator saw that
his guest was no mere bead-telling mendicant, but a scholar of parts.
And they went at it all over again, the lama taking snuff, wiping his
spectacles, and talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of
Urdu and Tibetan.  He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims,
Fu-Hiouen and Hwen-Tsiang, and was anxious to know if there was any
translation of their record.  He drew in his breath as he turned
helplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien.  ''Tis all
here.  A treasure locked.'  Then he composed himself reverently to
listen to fragments hastily rendered into Urdu.  For the first time he
heard of the labours of European scholars, who by the help of these and
a hundred other documents have identified the Holy Places of Buddhism.
Then he was shown a mighty map, spotted and traced with yellow.  The
brown finger followed the Curator's pencil from point to point.  Here
was Kapilavastu, here the Middle Kingdom, and here Mahabodhi, the Mecca
of Buddhism; and here was Kusinagara, sad place of the Holy One's
death.  The old man bowed his head over the sheets in silence for a
while, and the Curator lit another pipe.  Kim had fallen asleep.  When
he waked, the talk, still in spate, was more within his comprehension.

'And thus it was, O Fountain of Wisdom, that I decided to go to the
Holy Places which His foot had trod--to the Birthplace, even to Kapila;
then to Mahabodhi, which is Buddh Gaya--to the Monastery--to the
Deer-park--to the place of His death.'

The lama lowered his voice.  'And I come here alone.  For
five--seven--eighteen--forty years it was in my mind that the Old Law
was not well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom,
charms, and idolatry.  Even as the child outside said but now.  Ay,
even as the child said, with but-parasti.'

'So it comes with all faiths.'

'Thinkest thou?  The books of my lamassery I read, and they were dried
pith; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have
cumbered ourselves--that, too, had no worth to these old eyes.  Even
the followers of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one
another.  It is all illusion.  Ay, maya, illusion. But I have another
desire'--the seamed yellow face drew within three inches of the
Curator, and the long forefinger-nail tapped on the table.  'Your
scholars, by these books, have followed the Blessed Feet in all their
wanderings; but there are things which they have not sought out.  I
know nothing--nothing do I know--but I go to free myself from the Wheel
of Things by a broad and open road.'  He smiled with most simple
triumph.  'As a pilgrim to the Holy Places I acquire merit.  But there
is more.  Listen to a true thing.  When our gracious Lord, being as yet
a youth, sought a mate, men said, in His father's Court, that He was
too tender for marriage.  Thou knowest?'

The Curator nodded, wondering what would come next.

'So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at
the test of the Bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him,
called for such a bow as none might bend.  Thou knowest?'

'It is written.  I have read.'

'And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond
sight.  At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke
out a stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our
Lord's beneficence, and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is
that whoso bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin.'

'So it is written,' said the Curator sadly.

The lama drew a long breath.  'Where is that River?  Fountain of
Wisdom, where fell the arrow?'

'Alas, my brother, I do not know,' said the Curator.

'Nay, if it please thee to forget--the one thing only that thou hast
not told me.  Surely thou must know?  See, I am an old man!  I ask with
my head between thy feet, O Fountain of Wisdom.  We know He drew the
bow!  We know the arrow fell!  We know the stream gushed!  Where, then,
is the River?  My dream told me to find it. So I came.  I am here.  But
where is the River?'

'If I knew, think you I would not cry it aloud?'

'By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things,' the lama went on,
unheeding.  'The River of the Arrow!  Think again!  Some little stream,
maybe--dried in the heats?  But the Holy One would never so cheat an
old man.'

'I do not know.  I do not know.'

The lama brought his thousand-wrinkled face once more a handsbreadth
from the Englishman's.  'I see thou dost not know. Not being of the
Law, the matter is hid from thee.'

'Ay--hidden--hidden.'

'We are both bound, thou and I, my brother.  But I'--he rose with a
sweep of the soft thick drapery--'I go to cut myself free. Come also!'

'I am bound,' said the Curator.  'But whither goest thou?'

'First to Kashi [Benares]:  where else?  There I shall meet one of the
pure faith in a Jain temple of that city.  He also is a Seeker in
secret, and from him haply I may learn.  Maybe he will go with me to
Buddh Gaya.  Thence north and west to Kapilavastu, and there will I
seek for the River.  Nay, I will seek everywhere as I go--for the place
is not known where the arrow fell.'

'And how wilt thou go?  It is a far cry to Delhi, and farther to
Benares.'

'By road and the trains.  From Pathankot, having left the Hills, I came
hither in a te-rain.  It goes swiftly.  At first I was amazed to see
those tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching up
their threads,'--he illustrated the stoop and whirl of a telegraph-pole
flashing past the train.  'But later, I was cramped and desired to
walk, as I am used.'

'And thou art sure of thy road?'  said the Curator.

'Oh, for that one but asks a question and pays money, and the appointed
persons despatch all to the appointed place.  That much I knew in my
lamassery from sure report,' said the lama proudly.

'And when dost thou go?'  The Curator smiled at the mixture of
old-world piety and modern progress that is the note of India today.

'As soon as may be.  I follow the places of His life till I come to the
River of the Arrow.  There is, moreover, a written paper of the hours
of the trains that go south.'

'And for food?'  Lamas, as a rule, have good store of money somewhere
about them, but the Curator wished to make sure.

'For the journey, I take up the Master's begging-bowl.  Yes.  Even as
He went so go I, forsaking the ease of my monastery.  There was with me
when I left the hills a chela [disciple] who begged for me as the Rule
demands, but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died.  I
have now no chela, but I will take the alms-bowl and thus enable the
charitable to acquire merit.'  He nodded his head valiantly.  Learned
doctors of a lamassery do not beg, but the lama was an enthusiast in
this quest.

'Be it so,' said the Curator, smiling.  'Suffer me now to acquire
merit.  We be craftsmen together, thou and I. Here is a new book of
white English paper:  here be sharpened pencils two and three--thick
and thin, all good for a scribe.  Now lend me thy spectacles.'

The Curator looked through them.  They were heavily scratched, but the
power was almost exactly that of his own pair, which he slid into the
lama's hand, saying:  'Try these.'

'A feather!  A very feather upon the face.'  The old man turned his
head delightedly and wrinkled up his nose.  'How scarcely do I feel
them!  How clearly do I see!'

'They be bilaur--crystal--and will never scratch.  May they help thee
to thy River, for they are thine.'

'I will take them and the pencils and the white note-book,' said the
lama, 'as a sign of friendship between priest and priest--and now--' He
fumbled at his belt, detached the open-work iron pincers, and laid it
on the Curator's table.  'That is for a memory between thee and me--my
pencase.  It is something old--even as I am.'

It was a piece of ancient design, Chinese, of an iron that is not
smelted these days; and the collector's heart in the Curator's bosom
had gone out to it from the first.  For no persuasion would the lama
resume his gift.

'When I return, having found the River, I will bring thee a written
picture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the
lamassery.  Yes--and of the Wheel of Life,' he chuckled, 'for we be
craftsmen together, thou and I.'

The Curator would have detained him:  they are few in the world who
still have the secret of the conventional brush-pen Buddhist pictures
which are, as it were, half written and half drawn.  But the lama
strode out, head high in air, and pausing an instant before the great
statue of a Bodhisat in meditation, brushed through the turnstiles.

Kim followed like a shadow.  What he had overheard excited him wildly.
This man was entirely new to all his experience, and he meant to
investigate further, precisely as he would have investigated a new
building or a strange festival in Lahore city. The lama was his trove,
and he purposed to take possession.  Kim's mother had been Irish, too.

The old man halted by Zam-Zammah and looked round till his eye fell on
Kim.  The inspiration of his pilgrimage had left him for awhile, and he
felt old, forlorn, and very empty.

'Do not sit under that gun,' said the policeman loftily.

'Huh!  Owl!'  was Kim's retort on the lama's behalf.  'Sit under that
gun if it please thee.  When didst thou steal the milkwoman's slippers,
Dunnoo?'

That was an utterly unfounded charge sprung on the spur of the moment,
but it silenced Dunnoo, who knew that Kim's clear yell could call up
legions of bad bazaar boys if need arose.

'And whom didst thou worship within?'  said Kim affably, squatting in
the shade beside the lama.

'I worshipped none, child.  I bowed before the Excellent Law.'

Kim accepted this new God without emotion.  He knew already a few score.

'And what dost thou do?'

'I beg.  I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk. What is
the custom of charity in this town?  In silence, as we do of Tibet, or
speaking aloud?'

'Those who beg in silence starve in silence,' said Kim, quoting a
native proverb.  The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing
for his disciple, dead in far-away Kulu.  Kim watched head to one side,
considering and interested.

'Give me the bowl.  I know the people of this city--all who are
charitable.  Give, and I will bring it back filled.'

Simply as a child the old man handed him the bowl.

'Rest, thou.  I know the people.'

He trotted off to the open shop of a kunjri, a low-caste
vegetable-seller, which lay opposite the belt-tramway line down the
Motee Bazar.  She knew Kim of old.

'Oho, hast thou turned yogi with thy begging-bowl?'  she cried.

'Nay.'  said Kim proudly.  'There is a new priest in the city--a man
such as I have never seen.'

'Old priest--young tiger,' said the woman angrily.  'I am tired of new
priests!  They settle on our wares like flies.  Is the father of my son
a well of charity to give to all who ask?'

'No,' said Kim.  'Thy man is rather yagi [bad-tempered] than yogi [a
holy man].  But this priest is new.  The Sahib in the Wonder House has
talked to him like a brother.  O my mother, fill me this bowl.  He
waits.'

'That bowl indeed!  That cow-bellied basket!  Thou hast as much grace
as the holy bull of Shiv.  He has taken the best of a basket of onions
already, this morn; and forsooth, I must fill thy bowl. He comes here
again.'

The huge, mouse-coloured Brahmini bull of the ward was shouldering his
way through the many-coloured crowd, a stolen plantain hanging out of
his mouth.  He headed straight for the shop, well knowing his
privileges as a sacred beast, lowered his head, and puffed heavily
along the line of baskets ere making his choice.  Up flew Kim's hard
little heel and caught him on his moist blue nose.  He snorted
indignantly, and walked away across the tram-rails, his hump quivering
with rage.

'See!  I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over.  Now,
mother, a little rice and some dried fish atop--yes, and some vegetable
curry.'

A growl came out of the back of the shop, where a man lay.

'He drove away the bull,' said the woman in an undertone.  'It is good
to give to the poor.'  She took the bowl and returned it full of hot
rice.

'But my yogi is not a cow,' said Kim gravely, making a hole with his
fingers in the top of the mound.  'A little curry is good, and a fried
cake, and a morsel of conserve would please him, I think.'

'It is a hole as big as thy head,' said the woman fretfully.  But she
filled it, none the less, with good, steaming vegetable curry, clapped
a fried cake atop, and a morsel of clarified butter on the cake, dabbed
a lump of sour tamarind conserve at the side; and Kim looked at the
load lovingly.

'That is good.  When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this
house.  He is a bold beggar-man.'

'And thou?'  laughed the woman.  'But speak well of bulls.  Hast thou
not told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help
thee?  Now hold all straight and ask for the holy man's blessing upon
me.  Perhaps, too, he knows a cure for my daughter's sore eyes.  Ask.
him that also, O thou Little Friend of all the World.'

But Kim had danced off ere the end of the sentence, dodging pariah dogs
and hungry acquaintances.

'Thus do we beg who know the way of it,' said he proudly to the lama,
who opened his eyes at the contents of the bowl.  'Eat now and--I will
eat with thee.  Ohe, bhisti!'  he called to the water-carrier, sluicing
the crotons by the Museum.  'Give water here.  We men are thirsty.'

'We men!'  said the bhisti, laughing.  'Is one skinful enough for such
a pair?  Drink, then, in the name of the Compassionate.'

He loosed a thin stream into Kim's hands, who drank native fashion; but
the lama must needs pull out a cup from his inexhaustible upper
draperies and drink ceremonially.

'Pardesi [a foreigner],' Kim explained, as the old man delivered in an
unknown tongue what was evidently a blessing.

They ate together in great content, clearing the beggingbowl. Then the
lama took snuff from a portentous wooden snuff-gourd, fingered his
rosary awhile, and so dropped into the easy sleep of age, as the shadow
of Zam-Zammah grew long.

Kim loafed over to the nearest tobacco-seller, a rather lively young
Mohammedan woman, and begged a rank cigar of the brand that they sell
to students of the Punjab University who copy English customs.  Then he
smoked and thought, knees to chin, under the belly of the gun, and the
outcome of his thoughts was a sudden and stealthy departure in the
direction of Nila Ram's timber-yard.

The lama did not wake till the evening life of the city had begun with
lamp-lighting and the return of white-robed clerks and subordinates
from the Government offices.  He stared dizzily in all directions, but
none looked at him save a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and
Isabella-coloured clothes.  Suddenly he bowed his head on his knees and
wailed.

'What is this?'  said the boy, standing before him.  'Hast thou been
robbed?'

'It is my new chela [disciple] that is gone away from me, and I know
not where he is.'

'And what like of man was thy disciple?'

'It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died, on account of
the merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there.'
He pointed towards the Museum.  'He came upon me to show me a road
which I had lost.  He led me into the Wonder House, and by his talk
emboldened me to speak to the Keeper of the Images, so that I was
cheered and made strong.  And when I was faint with hunger he begged
for me, as would a chela for his teacher.  Suddenly was he sent.
Suddenly has he gone away.  It was in my mind to have taught him the
Law upon the road to Benares.'

Kim stood amazed at this, because he had overheard the talk in the
Museum, and knew that the old man was speaking the truth, which is a
thing a native on the road seldom presents to a stranger.

'But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose.  By this I know that
I shall find a certain River for which I seek.'

'The River of the Arrow?'  said Kim, with a superior smile.

'Is this yet another Sending?'  cried the lama.  'To none have I spoken
of my search, save to the Priest of the Images.  Who art thou?'

'Thy chela,' said Kim simply, sitting on his heels.  'I have never seen
anyone like to thee in all this my life.  I go with thee to Benares.
And, too, I think that so old a man as thou, speaking the truth to
chance-met people at dusk, is in great need of a disciple.'

'But the River--the River of the Arrow?'

'Oh, that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman.  I lay
against the door.'

The lama sighed.  'I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted. Such
things fall sometimes--but I am not worthy.  Thou dost not, then, know
the River?'

'Not I,' Kim laughed uneasily.  'I go to look for--for a bull--a Red.
Bull on a green field who shall help me.'  Boylike, if an acquaintance
had a scheme, Kim was quite ready with one of his own; and, boylike, he
had really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his
father's prophecy.

'To what, child?'  said the lama.

'God knows, but so my father told me'.  I heard thy talk in the Wonder
House of all those new strange places in the Hills, and if one so old
and so little--so used to truth-telling--may go out for the small
matter of a river, it seemed to me that I too must go a-travelling.  If
it is our fate to find those things we shall find them--thou, thy
River; and I, my Bull, and the Strong Pillars and some other matters
that I forget.'

'It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free,' said the
lama.

'That is all one.  Perhaps they will make me a king,' said Kim,
serenely prepared for anything.

'I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road,' the lama
replied in the voice of authority.  'Let us go to Benares.'

'Not by night.  Thieves are abroad.  Wait till the day.'

'But there is no place to sleep.'  The old man was used to the order of
his monastery, and though he slept on the ground, as the Rule decrees,
preferred a decency in these things.

'We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai,' said Kim, laughing at
his perplexity.  'I have a friend there.  Come!'

The hot and crowded bazars blazed with light as they made their way
through the press of all the races in Upper India, and the lama mooned
through it like a man in a dream.  It was his first experience of a
large manufacturing city, and the crowded tram-car with its continually
squealing brakes frightened him.  Half pushed, half towed, he arrived
at the high gate of the Kashmir Serai:  that huge open square over
against the railway station, surrounded with arched cloisters, where
the camel and horse caravans put up on their return from Central Asia.
Here were all manner of Northern folk, tending tethered ponies and
kneeling camels; loading and unloading bales and bundles; drawing water
for the evening meal at the creaking well-windlasses; piling grass
before the shrieking, wild-eyed stallions; cuffing the surly caravan
dogs; paying off camel-drivers; taking on new grooms; swearing,
shouting, arguing, and chaffering in the packed square.  The cloisters,
reached by three or four masonry steps, made a haven of refuge around
this turbulent sea.  Most of them were rented to traders, as we rent
the arches of a viaduct; the space between pillar and pillar being
bricked or boarded off into rooms, which were guarded by heavy wooden
doors and cumbrous native padlocks.  Locked doors showed that the owner
was away, and a few rude--sometimes very rude--chalk or paint scratches
told where he had gone.  Thus:  'Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan.'
Below, in coarse verse:  'O Allah, who sufferest lice to live on the
coat of a Kabuli, why hast thou allowed this louse Lutuf to live so
long?'

Kim, fending the lama between excited men and excited beasts, sidled
along the cloisters to the far end, nearest therailway station, where
Mahbub Ali, the horse-trader, lived when he came in from that
mysterious land beyond the Passes of the North.

Kim had had many dealings with Mahbub in his little life, especially
between his tenth and his thirteenth year--and the big burly Afghan,
his beard dyed scarlet with lime (for he was elderly and did not wish
his grey hairs to show), knew the boy's value as a gossip.  Sometimes
he would tell Kim to watch a man who had nothing whatever to do with
horses:  to follow him for one whole day and report every soul with
whom he talked.  Kim would deliver himself of his tale at evening, and
Mahbub would listen without a word or gesture.  It was intrigue of some
kind, Kim knew; but its worth lay in saying nothing whatever to anyone
except Mahbub, who gave him beautiful meals all hot from the cookshop
at the head of the serai, and once as much as eight annas in money.

'He is here,' said Kim, hitting a bad-tempered camel on the nose. 'Ohe.
Mahbub Ali!'  He halted at a dark arch and slipped behind the
bewildered lama.

The horse-trader, his deep, embroidered Bokhariot belt unloosed, was
lying on a pair of silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an
immense silver hookah.  He turned his head very slightly at the cry;
and seeing only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his deep chest.

'Allah!  A lama!  A Red Lama!  It is far from Lahore to the Passes.
What dost thou do here?'

The lama held out the begging-bowl mechanically.

'God's curse on all unbelievers!'  said Mahbub.  'I do not give to a
lousy Tibetan; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels. They
may value your blessings.  Oh, horseboys, here is a countryman of
yours.  See if he be hungry.'

A shaven, crouching Balti, who had come down with the horses, and who
was nominally some sort of degraded Buddhist, fawned upon the priest,
and in thick gutturals besought the Holy One to sit at the horseboys'
fire.

'Go!'  said Kim, pushing him lightly, and the lama strode away, leaving
Kim at the edge of the cloister.

'Go!'  said Mahbub Ali, returning to his hookah.  'Little Hindu, run
away.  God's curse on all unbelievers!  Beg from those of my tail who
are of thy faith.'

'Maharaj,' whined Kim, using the Hindu form of address, and thoroughly
enjoying the situation; 'my father is dead--my mother is dead--my
stomach is empty.'

'Beg from my men among the horses, I say.  There must be some Hindus in
my tail.'

'Oh, Mahbub Ali, but am I a Hindu?'  said Kim in English.

The trader gave no sign of astonishment, but looked under shaggy
eyebrows.

'Little Friend of all the World,' said he, 'what is this?'

'Nothing.  I am now that holy man's disciple; and we go a pilgrimage
together--to Benares, he says.  He is quite mad, and I am tired of
Lahore city.  I wish new air and water.'

'But for whom dost thou work?  Why come to me?'  The voice was harsh
with suspicion.

'To whom else should I come?  I have no money.  It is not good to go
about without money.  Thou wilt sell many horses to the officers.  They
are very fine horses, these new ones:  I have seen them.  Give me a
rupee, Mahbub Ali, and when I come to my wealth I will give thee a bond
and pay.'

'Um!'  said Mahbub Ali, thinking swiftly.  'Thou hast never before lied
to me.  Call that lama--stand back in the dark.'

'Oh, our tales will agree,' said Kim, laughing.

'We go to Benares,' said the lama, as soon as he understood the drift
of Mahbub Ali's questions.  'The boy and I, I go to seek for a certain
River.'

'Maybe--but the boy?'

'He is my disciple.  He was sent, I think, to guide me to that River.
Sitting under a gun was I when he came suddenly.  Such things have
befallen the fortunate to whom guidance was allowed. But I remember
now, he said he was of this world--a Hindu.'

'And his name?'

'That I did not ask.  Is he not my disciple?'

'His country--his race--his village?  Mussalman--Sikh Hindu--Jain--low
caste or high?'

'Why should I ask?  There is neither high nor low in the Middle Way.
If he is my chela--does--will--can anyone take him from me?  for, look
you, without him I shall not find my River.'  He wagged his head
solemnly.

'None shall take him from thee.  Go, sit among my Baltis,' said Mahbub
Ali, and the lama drifted off, soothed by the promise.

'Is he not quite mad?'  said Kim, coming forward to the light again.
'Why should I lie to thee, Hajji?'

Mahbub puffed his hookah in silence.  Then he began, almost whispering:
'Umballa is on the road to Benares--if indeed ye two go there.'

'Tck!  Tck!  I tell thee he does not know how to lie--as we two know.'

'And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give
thee money.  It concerns a horse--a white stallion which I have sold to
an officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes.  But
then--stand nearer and hold up hands as begging--the pedigree of the
white stallion was not fully established, and that officer, who is now
at Umballa, bade me make it clear.'  (Mahbub here described the horse
and the appearance of the officer.) 'So the message to that officer
will be:  "The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established."
By this will he know that thou comest from me.  He will then say "What
proof hast thou?"  and thou wilt answer:  "Mahbub Ali has given me the
proof."'

'And all for the sake of a white stallion,' said Kim, with a giggle,
his eyes aflame.

'That pedigree I will give thee now--in my own fashion and some hard
words as well.'  A shadow passed behind Kim, and a feeding camel.
Mahbub Ali raised his voice.

'Allah!  Art thou the only beggar in the city?  Thy mother is dead. Thy
father is dead.  So is it with all of them.  Well, well--'

He turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft,
greasy Mussalman bread to the boy.  'Go and lie down among my horseboys
for tonight--thou and the lama.  Tomorrow I may give thee service.'

Kim slunk away, his teeth in the bread, and, as he expected, he found a
small wad of folded tissue-paper wrapped in oilskin, with three silver
rupees--enormous largesse.  He smiled and thrust money and paper into
his leather amulet-case.  The lama, sumptuously fed by Mahbub's Baltis,
was already asleep in a corner of one of the stalls.  Kim lay down
beside him and laughed. He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub
Ali, and not for one little minute did he believe the tale of the
stallion's pedigree.

But Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali, known as one of the best
horse-dealers in the Punjab, a wealthy and enterprising trader, whose
caravans penetrated far and far into the Back of Beyond, was registered
in one of the locked books of the Indian Survey Department as C25 IB.
Twice or thrice yearly C25 would send in a little story, baldly told
but most interesting, and generally--it was checked by the statements
of R17 and M4--quite true.  It concerned all manner of out-of-the-way
mountain principalities, explorers of nationalities other than English,
and the guntrade--was, in brief, a small portion of that vast mass of
'information received' on which the Indian Government acts.  But,
recently, five confederated Kings, who had no business to confederate,
had been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a leakage
of news from their territories into British India.  So those Kings'
Prime Ministers were seriously annoyed and took steps, after the
Oriental fashion.  They suspected, among many others, the bullying,
red-bearded horsedealer whose caravans ploughed through their
fastnesses belly-deep in snow.  At least, his caravan that season had
been ambushed and shot at twice on the way down, when Mahbub's men
accounted for three strange ruffians who might, or might not, have been
hired for the job.  Therefore Mahbub had avoided halting at the
insalubrious city of Peshawur, and had come through without stop to
Lahore, where, knowing his country-people, he anticipated curious
developments.

And there was that on Mahbub Ali which he did not wish to keep an hour
longer than was necessary--a wad of closely folded tissue-paper,
wrapped in oilskin--an impersonal, unaddressed statement, with five
microscopic pin-holes in one corner, that most scandalously betrayed
the five confederated Kings, the sympathetic Northern Power, a Hindu
banker in Peshawur, a firm of gun-makers in Belgium, and an important,
semi-independent Mohammedan ruler to the south.  This last was R17's
work, which Mahbub had picked up beyond the Dora Pass and was carrying
in for R17, who, owing to circumstances over which he had no control,
could not leave his post of observation.  Dynamite was milky and
innocuous beside that report of C25; and even an Oriental, with an
Oriental's views of the value of time, could see that the sooner it was
in the proper hands the better.  Mahbub had no particular desire to die
by violence, because two or three family blood-feuds across the Border
hung unfinished on his hands, and when these scores were cleared he
intended to settle down as a more or less virtuous citizen.  He had
never passed the serai gate since his arrival two days ago, but had
been ostentatious in sending telegrams to Bombay, where he banked some
of his money; to Delhi, where a sub-partner of his own clan was selling
horses to the agent of a Rajputana state; and to Umballa, where an
Englishman was excitedly demanding the pedigree of a white stallion.
The public letter-writer, who knew English, composed excellent
telegrams, such as:  'Creighton, Laurel Bank, Umballa. Horse is Arabian
as already advised.  Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am translating.'
And later to the same address:  'Much sorrowful delay.  Will forward
pedigree.'  To his sub-partner at Delhi he wired:  'Lutuf Ullah.  Have
wired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman Narain's bank--' This was
entirely in the way of trade, but every one of those telegrams was
discussed and rediscussed, by parties who conceived themselves to be
interested, before they went over to the railway station in charge of a
foolish Balti, who allowed all sorts of people to read them on the road.

When, in Mahbub's own picturesque language, he had muddied the wells of
inquiry with the stick of precaution, Kim had dropped on him, sent from
Heaven; and, being as prompt as he was unscrupulous, Mahbub Ali used to
taking all sorts of gusty chances, pressed him into service on the spot.

A wandering lama with a low-caste boy-servant might attract a moment's
interest as they wandered about India, the land of pilgrims; but no one
would suspect them or, what was more to the point, rob.

He called for a new light-ball to his hookah, and considered the case.
If the worst came to the worst, and the boy came to harm, the paper
would incriminate nobody.  And he would go up to Umballa leisurely
and--at a certain risk of exciting fresh suspicion--repeat his tale by
word of mouth to the people concerned.

But R17's report was the kernel of the whole affair, and it would be
distinctly inconvenient if that failed to come to hand. However, God
was great, and Mahbub Ali felt he had done all he could for the time
being.  Kim was the one soul in the world who had never told him a lie.
That would have been a fatal blot on Kim's character if Mahbub had not
known that to others, for his own ends or Mahbub's business, Kim could
lie like an Oriental.

Then Mahbub Ali rolled across the serai to the Gate of the Harpies who
paint their eyes and trap the stranger, and was at some pains to call
on the one girl who, he had reason to believe, was a particular friend
of a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit who had waylaid his simple Balti in
the matter of the telegrams.  It was an utterly foolish thing to do;
because they fell to drinking perfumed brandy against the Law of the
Prophet, and Mahbub grew wonderfully drunk, and the gates of his mouth
were loosened, and he pursued the Flower of Delight with the feet of
intoxication till he fell flat among the cushions, where the Flower of
Delight, aided by a smooth-faced Kashmiri pundit, searched him from
head to foot most thoroughly.

About the same hour Kim heard soft feet in Mahbub's deserted stall.
The horse-trader, curiously enough, had left his door unlocked, and his
men were busy celebrating their return to India with a whole sheep of
Mahbub's bounty.  A sleek young gentleman from Delhi, armed with a
bunch of keys which the Flower had unshackled from the senseless one's
belt, went through every single box, bundle, mat, and saddle-bag in
Mahbub's possession even more systematically than the Flower and the
pundit were searching the owner.

'And I think.'  said the Flower scornfully an hour later, one rounded
elbow on the snoring carcass, 'that he is no more than a pig of an
Afghan horse-dealer, with no thought except women and horses.
Moreover, he may have sent it away by now--if ever there were such a
thing.'

'Nay--in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black
heart,' said the pundit.  'Was there nothing?'

The Delhi man laughed and resettled his turban as he entered.  'I
searched between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his
clothes.  This is not the man but another.  I leave little unseen.'

'They did not say he was the very man,' said the pundit thoughtfully.
'They said, "Look if he be the man, since our counsels are troubled."'

'That North country is full of horse-dealers as an old coat of lice.
There is Sikandar Khan, Nur Ali Beg, and Farrukh Shah all heads of
kafilas [caravans]--who deal there,' said the Flower.

'They have not yet come in,' said the pundit.  'Thou must ensnare them
later.'

Phew!'  said the Flower with deep disgust, rolling Mahbub's head from
her lap.  'I earn my money.  Farrukh Shah is a bear, Ali Beg a
swashbuckler, and old Sikandar Khan--yaie!  Go!  I sleep now.  This
swine will not stir till dawn.'

When Mahbub woke, the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of
drunkenness.  Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an
enemy, but as Mahbub Ali cleared his throat, tightened his belt, and
staggered forth under the early morning stars, he came very near to it.

'What a colt's trick!'  said he to himself.  'As if every girl in
Peshawur did not use it!  But 'twas prettily done.  Now God He knows
how many more there be upon the Road who have orders to test
me--perhaps with the knife.  So it stands that the boy must go to
Umballa--and by rail--for the writing is something urgent.  I abide
here, following the Flower and drinking wine as an Afghan coper should.'

He halted at the stall next but one to his own.  His men lay there
heavy with sleep.  There was no sign of Kim or the lama.

'Up!'  He stirred a sleeper.  'Whither went those who lay here last
even--the lama and the boy?  Is aught missing?'

'Nay,' grunted the man, 'the old madman rose at second cockcrow saying
he would go to Benares, and the young one led him away.'

'The curse of Allah on all unbelievers!'  said Mahbub heartily, and
climbed into his own stall, growling in his beard.

But it was Kim who had wakened the lama--Kim with one eye laid against
a knot-hole in the planking, who had seen the Delhi man's search
through the boxes.  This was no common thief that turned over letters,
bills, and saddles--no mere burglar who ran a little knife sideways
into the soles of Mahbub's slippers, or picked the seams of the
saddle-bags so deftly.  At first Kim had been minded to give the
alarm--the long-drawn choor--choor! [thief!  thief!] that sets the
serai ablaze of nights; but he looked more carefully, and, hand on
amulet, drew his own conclusions.

'It must be the pedigree of that made-up horse-lie,' said he, 'the
thing that I carry to Umballa.  Better that we go now.  Those who
search bags with knives may presently search bellies with knives.
Surely there is a woman behind this.  Hai!  Hai!  in a whisper to the
light-sleeping old man.  'Come.  It is time--time to go to Benares.'

The lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai like shadows.




Chapter 2


  And whoso will, from Pride released;
  Contemning neither creed nor priest,
  May feel the Soul of all the East.
  About him at Kamakura.

  Buddha at Kamakura.


They entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night;
the electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy
Northern grain-traffic.

'This is the work of devils!'  said the lama, recoiling from the hollow
echoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms,
and the maze of girders above.  He stood in a gigantic stone hall
paved, it seemed, with the sheeted dead third-class passengers who had
taken their tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms.
All hours of the twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their
passenger traffic is regulated accordingly.

'This is where the fire-carriages come.  One stands behind that
hole'--Kim pointed to the ticket-office--'who will give thee a paper to
take thee to Umballa.'

'But we go to Benares,' he replied petulantly.

'All one.  Benares then.  Quick:  she comes!'

'Take thou the purse.'

The lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as
the 3.25 a.m. south-bound roared in.  The sleepers sprang to life, and
the station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and
sweetmeat vendors, shouts of native policemen, and shrill yells of
women gathering up their baskets, their families, and their husbands.

'It is the train--only the te-rain.  It will not come here. Wait!'
Amazed at the lama's immense simplicity (he had handed him a small bag
full of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa.  A sleepy
clerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six
miles distant.

'Nay,' said Kim, scanning it with a grin.  'This may serve for farmers,
but I live in the city of Lahore.  It was cleverly done, Babu.  Now
give the ticket to Umballa.'

The Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.

'Now another to Amritzar,' said Kim, who had no notion of spending
Mahbub Ali's money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa.
'The price is so much.  The small money in return is just so much.  I
know the ways of the te-rain ...  Never did yogi need chela as thou
dost,' he went on merrily to the bewildered lama.  'They would have
flung thee out at Mian Mir but for me. This way!  Come!'  He returned
the money, keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the
Umballa ticket as his commission--the immemorial commission of Asia.

The lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage.
'Were it not better to walk?'  said he weakly.

A burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head.  'Is he afraid?  Do
not be afraid.  I remember the time when I was afraid of the te-rain.
Enter!  This thing is the work of the Government.'

'I do not fear,' said the lama.  'Have ye room within for two?'

'There is no room even for a mouse,' shrilled the wife of a well-to-do
cultivator--a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur, district. Our night
trains are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes
are very strictly kept to separate carriages.

'Oh, mother of my son, we can make space,' said the blueturbaned
husband.  'Pick up the child.  It is a holy man, see'st thou?'

'And my lap full of seventy times seven bundles!  Why not bid him sit
on my knee, Shameless?  But men are ever thus!'  She looked round for
approval.  An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her
head drapery.

'Enter!  Enter!'  cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded
account-book in a cloth under his arm.  With an oily smirk:  'It is
well to be kind to the poor.'

'Ay, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,'
said a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.

'Will it travel to Benares?'  said the lama.

'Assuredly.  Else why should we come?  Enter, or we are left,' cried
Kim.

'See!'  shrilled the Amritzar girl.  'He has never entered a train. Oh,
see!'

'Nay, help,' said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand and
hauling him in.  'Thus is it done, father.'

'But--but--I sit on the floor.  It is against the Rule to sit on a
bench,' said the lama.  'Moreover, it cramps me.'

'I say,' began the money-lender, pursing his lips, 'that there is not
one rule of right living which these te-rains do not cause us to break.
We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.'

'Yea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,' said the wife,
scowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.

'I said we might have gone by cart along the road,' said the husband,
'and thus have saved some money.'

'Yes--and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That was
talked out ten thousand times.'

'Ay, by ten thousand tongues,' grunted he.

'The Gods help us poor women if we may not speak.  Oho!  He is of that
sort which may not look at or reply to a woman.'  For the lama,
constrained by his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her.  'And his
disciple is like him?'

'Nay, mother,' said Kim most promptly.  'Not when the woman is
well-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.'

'A beggar's answer,' said the Sikh, laughing.  'Thou hast brought it on
thyself, sister!'  Kim's hands were crooked in supplication.

'And whither goest thou?'  said the woman, handing him the half of a
cake from a greasy package.

'Even to Benares.'

'Jugglers belike?'  the young soldier suggested.  'Have ye any tricks
to pass the time?  Why does not that yellow man answer?'


'Because,' said Kim stoutly, 'he is holy, and thinks upon matters
hidden from thee.'

'That may be well.  We of the Ludhiana Sikhs'--he rolled it out
sonorously--'do not trouble our heads with doctrine.  We fight.'

'My sister's brother's son is naik [corporal] in that regiment,' said
the Sikh craftsman quietly.  'There are also some Dogra companies
there.'  The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste than a Sikh,
and the banker tittered.

'They are all one to me,' said the Amritzar girl.

'That we believe,' snorted the cultivator's wife malignantly.

'Nay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are, as
it were, one brotherhood.  There is one brotherhood of the caste, but
beyond that again'--she looked round timidly--'the bond of the
Pulton--the Regiment--eh?'

'My brother is in a Jat regiment,' said the cultivator.  'Dogras be
good men.'

'Thy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,' said the soldier, with a
scowl at the placid old man in the corner.  'Thy Sikhs thought so when
our two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the face of
eight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.'

He told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of
the Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well.  The Amritzar girl
smiled; for she knew the talk was to win her approval.

'Alas!'  said the cultivator's wife at the end.  'So their villages
were burnt and their little children made homeless?'

'They had marked our dead.  They paid a great payment after we of the
Sikhs had schooled them.  So it was.  Is this Amritzar?'

'Ay, and here they cut our tickets,' said the banker, fumbling at his
belt.

The lamps were paling in the dawn when the half-caste guard came round.
Ticket-collecting is a slow business in the East, where people secrete
their tickets in all sorts of curious places.  Kim produced his and was
told to get out.

'But I go to Umballa,' he protested.  'I go with this holy man.'

'Thou canst go to Jehannum for aught I care.  This ticket is only--'

Kim burst into a flood of tears, protesting that the lama was his
father and his mother, that he was the prop of the lama's declining
years, and that the lama would die without his care. All the carriage
bade the guard be merciful--the banker was specially eloquent here--but
the guard hauled Kim on to the platform.  The lama blinked--he could
not overtake the situation and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside
the carriage window.

'I am very poor.  My father is dead--my mother is dead.  O charitable
ones, if I am left here, who shall tend that old man?'

'What--what is this?'  the lama repeated.  'He must go to Benares. He
must come with me.  He is my chela.  If there is money to be paid--'

'Oh, be silent,' whispered Kim; 'are we Rajahs to throw away good
silver when the world is so charitable?'

The Amritzar girl stepped out with her bundles, and it was on her that
Kim kept his watchful eye.  Ladies of that persuasion, he knew, were
generous.

'A ticket--a little tikkut to Umballa--O Breaker of Hearts!' She
laughed.  'Hast thou no charity?'

'Does the holy man come from the North?'

'From far and far in the North he comes,' cried Kim.  'From among the
hills.'

'There is snow among the pine-trees in the North--in the hills there is
snow.  My mother was from Kulu.  Get thee a ticket.  Ask him for a
blessing.'

'Ten thousand blessings,' shrilled Kim.  'O Holy One, a woman has given
us in charity so that I can come with thee--a woman with a golden
heart.  I run for the tikkut.'

The girl looked up at the lama, who had mechanically followed Kim to
the platform.  He bowed his head that he might not see her, and
muttered in Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd.

'Light come--light go,' said the cultivator's wife viciously.

'She has acquired merit,' returned the lama.  'Beyond doubt it was a
nun.'

'There be ten thousand such nuns in Amritzar alone.  Return, old man,
or the te-rain may depart without thee,' cried the banker.

'Not only was it sufficient for the ticket, but for a little food
also,' said Kim, leaping to his place.  'Now eat, Holy One.  Look. Day
comes!'

Golden, rose, saffron, and pink, the morning mists smoked away across
the flat green levels.  All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of
the keen sun.  The lama flinched a little as the telegraph-posts swung
by.

'Great is the speed of the te-rain,' said the banker, with a
patronizing grin.  'We have gone farther since Lahore than thou couldst
walk in two days:  at even, we shall enter Umballa.'

'And that is still far from Benares,' said the lama wearily, mumbling
over the cakes that Kim offered.  They all unloosed their bundles and
made their morning meal.  Then the banker, the cultivator, and the
soldier prepared their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking,
acrid smoke, spitting and coughing and enjoying themselves.  The Sikh
and the cultivator's wife chewed pan; the lama took snuff and told his
beads, while Kim, cross-legged, smiled over the comfort of a full
stomach.

'What rivers have ye by Benares?'  said the lama of a sudden to the
carriage at large.

'We have Gunga,' returned the banker, when the little titter had
subsided.

'What others?'

'What other than Gunga?'

'Nay, but in my mind was the thought of a certain River of healing.'

'That is Gunga.  Who bathes in her is made clean and goes to the Gods.
Thrice have I made pilgrimage to Gunga.'  He looked round proudly.

'There was need,' said the young sepoy drily, and the travellers' laugh
turned against the banker.

'Clean--to return again to the Gods,' the lama muttered.  'And to go
forth on the round of lives anew--still tied to the Wheel.' He shook
his head testily.  'But maybe there is a mistake.  Who, then, made
Gunga in the beginning?'

'The Gods.  Of what known faith art thou?'  the banker said, appalled.

'I follow the Law--the Most Excellent Law.  So it was the Gods that
made Gunga.  What like of Gods were they?'

The carriage looked at him in amazement.  It was inconceivable that
anyone should be ignorant of Gunga.

'What--what is thy God?'  said the money-lender at last.

'Hear!'  said the lama, shifting the rosary to his hand.  'Hear: for I
speak of Him now!  O people of Hind, listen!'

He began in Urdu the tale of the Lord Buddha, but, borne by his own
thoughts, slid into Tibetan and long-droned texts from a Chinese book
of the Buddha's life.  The gentle, tolerant folk looked on reverently.
All India is full of holy men stammering gospels in strange tongues;
shaken and consumed in the fires of their own zeal; dreamers, babblers,
and visionaries:  as it has been from the beginning and will continue
to the end.

'Um!'  said the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs.  'There was a Mohammedan
regiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal, and a priest of theirs--he
was, as I remember, a naik--when the fit was on him, spake prophecies.
But the mad all are in God's keeping.  His officers overlooked much in
that man.'

The lama fell back on Urdu, remembering that he was in a strange land.
'Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow,' he
said.

This was much more to their taste, and they listened curiously while he
told it.  'Now, O people of Hind, I go to seek that River.  Know ye
aught that may guide me, for we be all men and women in evil case.'

'There is Gunga--and Gunga alone--who washes away sin.'  ran the murmur
round the carriage.

'Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur-way,' said the
cultivator's wife, looking out of the window.  'See how they have
blessed the crops.'

'To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter,' said her
husband.  'For me, a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices,
and I thank Bhumia, the God of the Home-stead.'  He shrugged one
knotted, bronzed shoulder.

'Think you our Lord came so far North?'  said the lama, turning to Kim.

'It may be,' Kim replied soothingly, as he spat red pan-juice on the
floor.

'The last of the Great Ones,' said the Sikh with authority, 'was
Sikander Julkarn [Alexander the Great].  He paved the streets of
Jullundur and built a great tank near Umballa.  That pavement holds to
this day; and the tank is there also.  I never heard of thy God.'

'Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi,' said the young soldier
jestingly to Kim, quoting a Northern proverb.  'That is all that makes
a Sikh.'  But he did not say this very loud.

The lama sighed and shrank into himself, a dingy, shapeless mass. In
the pauses of their talk they could hear the low droning 'Om mane pudme
hum!  Om mane pudme hum!'--and the thick click of the wooden rosary
beads.

'It irks me,' he said at last.  'The speed and the clatter irk me.
Moreover, my chela, I think that maybe we have over-passed that River.'

'Peace, peace,' said Kim.  'Was not the River near Benares?  We are yet
far from the place.'

'But--if our Lord came North, it may be any one of these little ones
that we have run across.'

'I do not know.'

'But thou wast sent to me--wast thou sent to me?--for the merit I had
acquired over yonder at Such-zen.  From beside the cannon didst thou
come--bearing two faces--and two garbs.'

'Peace.  One must not speak of these things here,' whispered Kim.
'There was but one of me.  Think again and thou wilt remember.  A
boy--a Hindu boy--by the great green cannon.'

'But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among
images--who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the
Arrow?'

'He--we--went to the Ajaib-Gher in Lahore to pray before the Gods
there,' Kim explained to the openly listening company.  'And the Sahib
of the Wonder House talked to him--yes, this is truth as a brother.  He
is a very holy man, from far beyond the Hills. Rest, thou.  In time we
come to Umballa.'

'But my River--the River of my healing?'

'And then, if it please thee, we will go hunting for that River on
foot.  So that we miss nothing--not even a little rivulet in a
field-side.'

'But thou hast a Search of thine own?'  The lama--very pleased that he
remembered so well--sat bolt upright.

'Ay,' said Kim, humouring him.  The boy was entirely happy to be out
chewing pan and seeing new people in the great good-tempered world.

'It was a bull--a Red Bull that shall come and help thee and carry
thee--whither?  I have forgotten.  A Red Bull on a green field, was it
not?'

'Nay, it will carry me nowhere,' said Kim.  'It is but a tale I told
thee.'

'What is this?'  The cultivator's wife leaned forward, her bracelets
clinking on her arm.  'Do ye both dream dreams?  A Red Bull on a green
field, that shall carry thee to the heavens or what?  Was it a vision?
Did one make a prophecy?  We have a Red Bull in our village behind
Jullundur city, and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our
fields!'

'Give a woman an old wife's tale and a weaver-bird a leaf and a
thread', they will weave wonderful things,' said the Sikh.  'All holy
men dream dreams, and by following holy men their disciples attain that
power.'

'A Red Bull on a green field, was it?'  the lama repeated.  'In a
former life it may be thou hast acquired merit, and the Bull will come
to reward thee.'

'Nay--nay--it was but a tale one told to me--for a jest belike.  But I
will seek the Bull about Umballa, and thou canst look for thy River and
rest from the clatter of the train.'

'It may be that the Bull knows--that he is sent to guide us both.'
said the lama, hopefully as a child.  Then to the company, indicating
Kim:  'This one was sent to me but yesterday.  He is not, I think, of
this world.'

'Beggars aplenty have I met, and holy men to boot, but never such a
yogi nor such a disciple,' said the woman.

Her husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled.
But the next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of
their best.

And at last--tired, sleepy, and dusty--they reached Umballa City
Station.

'We abide here upon a law-suit,' said the cultivator's wife to Kim.
'We lodge with my man's cousin's younger brother.  There is room also
in the courtyard for thy yogi and for thee.  Will--will he give me a
blessing?'

'O holy man!  A woman with a heart of gold gives us lodging for the
night.  It is a kindly land, this land of the South.  See how we have
been helped since the dawn!'

The lama bowed his head in benediction.

'To fill my cousin's younger brother's house with wastrels--' the
husband began, as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff.

'Thy cousin's younger brother owes my father's cousin something yet on
his daughter's marriage-feast,' said the woman crisply. 'Let him put
their food to that account.  The yogi will beg, I doubt not.'

'Ay, I beg for him,' said Kim, anxious only to get the lama under
shelter for the night, that he might seek Mahbub Ali's Englishman and
deliver himself of the white stallion's pedigree.

'Now,' said he, when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner
courtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments, 'I go away
for a while--to--to buy us victual in the bazar.  Do not stray abroad
till I return.'

'Thou wilt return?  Thou wilt surely return?'  The old man caught at
his wrist.  'And thou wilt return in this very same shape?  Is it too
late to look tonight for the River?'

'Too late and too dark.  Be comforted.  Think how far thou art on the
road--an hundred miles from Lahore already.'

'Yea--and farther from my monastery.  Alas!  It is a great and terrible
world.'

Kim stole out and away, as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his
own and a few score thousand other folk's fate slung round his neck.
Mahbub Ali's directions left him little doubt of the house in which his
Englishman lived; and a groom, bringing a dog-cart home from the Club,
made him quite sure.  It remained only to identify his man, and Kim
slipped through the garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass
close to the veranda.  The house blazed with lights, and servants moved
about tables dressed with flowers, glass, and silver.  Presently forth
came an Englishman, dressed in black and white, humming a tune.  It was
too dark to see his face, so Kim, beggar-wise, tried an old experiment.

'Protector of the Poor!'

The man backed towards the voice.

'Mahbub Ali says--'

'Hah!  What says Mahbub Ali?'  He made no attempt to look for the
speaker, and that showed Kim that he knew.

'The pedigree of the white stallion is fully established.'

'What proof is there?'  The Englishman switched at the rose-hedge in
the side of the drive.

'Mahbub Ali has given me this proof.'  Kim flipped the wad of folded
paper into the air, and it fell in the path beside the man, who put his
foot on it as a gardener came round the corner. When the servant passed
he picked it up, dropped a rupee--Kim could hear the clink--and strode
into the house, never turning round.  Swiftly Kim took up the money;
but for all his training, he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver
the least part of any game.  What he desired was the visible effect of
action; so, instead of slinking away, he lay close in the grass and
wormed nearer to the house.

He saw--Indian bungalows are open through and through--the Englishman
return to a small dressing-room, in a comer of the veranda, that was
half office, littered with papers and despatch-boxes, and sit down to
study Mahbub Ali's message.  His face, by the full ray of the kerosene
lamp, changed and darkened, and Kim, used as every beggar must be to
watching countenances, took good note.

'Will!  Will, dear!'  called a woman's voice.  'You ought to be in the
drawing-room.  They'll be here in a minute.'

The man still read intently.

'Will!'  said the voice, five minutes later.  'He's come.  I can hear
the troopers in the drive.'

The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers
behind it halted at the veranda, and a tall, black haired man, erect as
an arrow, swung out, preceded by a young officer who laughed pleasantly.

Flat on his belly lay Kim, almost touching the high wheels.  His man
and the black stranger exchanged two sentences.

'Certainly, sir,' said the young officer promptly.  'Everything waits
while a horse is concerned.'

'We shan't be more than twenty minutes,' said Kim's man.  'You can do
the honours--keep 'em amused, and all that.'

'Tell one of the troopers to wait,' said the tall man, and they both
passed into the dressing-room together as the landau rolled away.  Kim
saw their heads bent over Mahbub Ali's message, and heard the
voices--one low and deferential, the other sharp and decisive.

'It isn't a question of weeks.  It is a question of days--hours
almost,' said the elder.  'I'd been expecting it for some time, but
this'--he tapped Mahbub Ali's paper--'clinches it.  Grogan's dining
here to-night, isn't he?'

'Yes, sir, and Macklin too.'

'Very good.  I'll speak to them myself.  The matter will be referred to
the Council, of course, but this is a case where one is justified in
assuming that we take action at once.  Warn the Pined and Peshawar
brigades.  It will disorganize all the summer reliefs, but we can't
help that.  This comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time.
Eight thousand should be enough.'

'What about artillery, sir?'

'I must consult Macklin.'

'Then it means war?'

'No.  Punishment.  When a man is bound by the action of his
predecessor--'

'But C25 may have lied.'

'He bears out the other's information.  Practically, they showed their
hand six months back.  But Devenish would have it there was a chance of
peace.  Of course they used it to make themselves stronger.  Send off
those telegrams at once--the new code, not the old--mine and Wharton's.
I don't think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer.  We can
settle the rest over the cigars.  I thought it was coming.  It's
punishment--not war.'

As the trooper cantered off, Kim crawled round to the back of the
house, where, going on his Lahore experiences, he judged there would be
food--and information.  The kitchen was crowded with excited scullions,
one of whom kicked him.

'Aie,' said Kim, feigning tears.  'I came only to wash dishes in return
for a bellyful.'

'All Umballa is on the same errand.  Get hence.  They go in now with
the soup.  Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange
scullions to help us through a big dinner?'

'It is a very big dinner,' said Kim, looking at the plates.

'Small wonder.  The guest of honour is none other than the Jang-i-Lat
Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief].'

'Ho!'  said Kim, with the correct guttural note of wonder.  He had
learned what he wanted, and when the scullion turned he was gone.

'And all that trouble,' said he to himself, thinking as usual in
Hindustani, 'for a horse's pedigree!  Mahbub Ali should have come to me
to learn a little lying.  Every time before that I have borne a message
it concerned a woman.  Now it is men.  Better.  The tall man said that
they will loose a great army to punish someone--somewhere--the news
goes to Pindi and Peshawur.  There are also guns.  Would I had crept
nearer.  It is big news!'

He returned to find the cultivator's cousin's younger brother
discussing the family law-suit in all its bearings with the cultivator
and his wife and a few friends, while the lama dozed. After the evening
meal some one passed him a water-pipe; and Kim felt very much of a man
as he pulled at the smooth coconut-shell, his legs spread abroad in the
moonlight, his tongue clicking in remarks from time to time.  His hosts
were most polite; for the cultivator's wife had told them of his vision
of the Red Bull, and of his probable descent from another world.
Moreover, the lama was a great and venerable curiosity.


The family priest, an old, tolerant Sarsut Brahmin, dropped in later,
and naturally started a theological argument to impress the family.  By
creed, of course, they were all on their priest's side, but the lama
was the guest and the novelty.  His gentle kindliness, and his
impressive Chinese quotations, that sounded like spells, delighted them
hugely; and in this sympathetic, simple air, he expanded like the
Bodhisat's own lotus, speaking of his life in the great hills of
Such-zen, before, as he said, 'I rose up to seek enlightenment.'

Then it came out that in those worldly days he had been a master-hand
at casting horoscopes and nativities; and the family priest led him on
to describe his methods; each giving the planets names that the other
could not understand, and pointing upwards as the big stars sailed
across the dark.  The children of the house tugged unrebuked at his
rosary; and he clean forgot the Rule which forbids looking at women as
he talked of enduring snows, landslips, blocked passes, the remote
cliffs where men find sapphires and turquoise, and that wonderful
upland road that leads at last into Great China itself.

'How thinkest thou of this one?'  said the cultivator aside to the
priest.

'A holy man--a holy man indeed.  His Gods are not the Gods, but his
feet are upon the Way,' was the answer.  'And his methods of
nativities, though that is beyond thee, are wise and sure.'

'Tell me,' said Kim lazily, 'whether I find my Red Bull on a green
field, as was promised me.'

'What knowledge hast thou of thy birth-hour?'  the priest asked,
swelling with importance.

'Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May.'

'Of what year?'

'I do not know; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great
earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir.'  This Kim had from the
woman who took care of him, and she again from Kimball O'Hara.  The
earthquake had been felt in India, and for long stood a leading date in
the Punjab.

'Ai!' said a woman excitedly.  This seemed to make Kim's supernatural
origin more certain.  'Was not such an one's daughter born then--'

'And her mother bore her husband four sons in four years all likely
boys,' cried the cultivator's wife, sitting outside the circle in the
shadow.

'None reared in the knowledge,' said the family priest, 'forget how the
planets stood in their Houses upon that night.'  He began to draw in
the dust of the courtyard.  'At least thou hast good claim to a half of
the House of the Bull.  How runs thy prophecy?'

'Upon a day,' said Kim, delighted at the sensation he was creating, 'I
shall be made great by means of a Red Bull on a green field, but first
there will enter two men making all things ready.'

'Yes:  thus ever at the opening of a vision.  A thick darkness that
clears slowly; anon one enters with a broom making ready the place.
Then begins the Sight.  Two men--thou sayest?  Ay, ay.  The Sun,
leaving the House of the Bull, enters that of the Twins. Hence the two
men of the prophecy.  Let us now consider.  Fetch me a twig, little
one.'

He knitted his brows, scratched, smoothed out, and scratched again in
the dust mysterious signs--to the wonder of all save the lama, who,
with fine instinct, forbore to interfere.

At the end of half an hour, he tossed the twig from him with a grunt.

'Hm!  Thus say the stars.  Within three days come the two men to make
all things ready.  After them follows the Bull; but the sign over
against him is the sign of War and armed men.'

'There was indeed a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from
Lahore,' said the cultivator's wife hopefully.

'Tck!  Armed men--many hundreds.  What concern hast thou with war?'
said the priest to Kim.  'Thine is a red and an angry sign of War to be
loosed very soon.'

'None--none.'  said the lama earnestly.  'We seek only peace and our
River.'

Kim smiled, remembering what he had overheard in the dressing-room.
Decidedly he was a favourite of the stars.

The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope.  'More than this I
cannot see.  In three days comes the Bull to thee, boy.'

'And my River, my River,' pleaded the lama.  'I had hoped his Bull
would lead us both to the River.'

'Alas, for that wondrous River, my brother,' the priest replied. 'Such
things are not common.'

Next morning, though they were pressed to stay, the lama insisted on
departure.  They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three
annas in copper money for the needs of the road, and with many
blessings watched the two go southward in the dawn.

'Pity it is that these and such as these could not be freed from--'

'Nay, then would only evil people be left on the earth, and who would
give us meat and shelter?'  quoth Kim, stepping merrily under his
burden.

'Yonder is a small stream.  Let us look,' said the lama, and he led
from the white road across the fields; walking into a very hornets'
nest of pariah dogs.




Chapter 3


  Yea, voice of every Soul that clung
  To life that strove from rung to rung
  When Devadatta's rule was young,
  The warm wind brings Kamakura.

  Buddha at Kamakura.


Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole.  He was a
market-gardener, Arain by caste, growing vegetables and flowers for
Umballa city, and well Kim knew the breed.

'Such an one,' said the lama, disregarding the dogs, 'is impolite to
strangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable.  Be warned by his
demeanour, my disciple.'

'Ho, shameless beggars!'  shouted the farmer.  'Begone!  Get hence!'

'We go,' the lama returned, with quiet dignity.  'We go from these
unblessed fields.'

'Ah,' said Kim, sucking in his breath.  'If the next crops fail, thou
canst only blame thine own tongue.'

The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers.  'The land is full of
beggars,' he began, half apologetically.

'And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O Mali?'
said Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least likes.
'All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there.'

'River, forsooth!'  the man snorted.  'What city do ye hail from not to
know a canal-cut?  It runs as straight as an arrow, and I pay for the
water as though it were molten silver.  There is a branch of a river
beyond.  But if ye need water I can give that--and milk.'

'Nay, we will go to the river,' said the lama, striding out.

'Milk and a meal.'  the man stammered, as he looked at the strange tall
figure.  'I--I would not draw evil upon myself--or my crops.  But
beggars are so many in these hard days.'

'Take notice.'  The lama turned to Kim.  'He was led to speak harshly
by the Red Mist of anger.  That clearing from his eyes, he becomes
courteous and of an affable heart.  May his fields be blessed!  Beware
not to judge men too hastily, O farmer.'

'I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to
byre,' said Kim to the abashed man.  'Is he not wise and holy? I am his
disciple.'

He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow
field-borders with great dignity.

'There is no pride,' said the lama, after a pause, 'there is no pride
among such as follow the Middle Way.'

'But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.'

'Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not? Afterwards
he amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is
as we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the
way of deliverance.'  He halted at a little runlet among the fields,
and considered the hoof-pitted bank.

'Now, how wilt thou know thy River?'  said Kim, squatting in the shade
of some tall sugar-cane.

'When I find it, an enlightenment will surely be given.  This, I feel,
is not the place.  O littlest among the waters, if only thou couldst
tell me where runs my River!  But be thou blessed to make the fields
bear!'

'Look!  Look!'  Kim sprang to his side and dragged him back.  A
yellow-and-brown streak glided from the purple rustling stems to the
bank, stretched its neck to the water, drank, and lay still--a big
cobra with fixed, lidless eyes.

'I have no stick--I have no stick,' said Kim.  'I will get me one and
break his back.'

'Why?  He is upon the Wheel as we are--a life ascending or
descending--very far from deliverance.  Great evil must the soul have
done that is cast into this shape.'

'I hate all snakes,' said Kim.  No native training can quench the white
man's horror of the Serpent.

'Let him live out his life.'  The coiled thing hissed and half opened
its hood.  'May thy release come soon, brother!'  the lama continued
placidly.  'Hast thou knowledge, by chance, of my River?'

'Never have I seen such a man as thou art,' Kim whispered, overwhelmed.
'Do the very snakes understand thy talk?'

'Who knows?'  He passed within a foot of the cobra's poised head. It
flattened itself among the dusty coils.

'Come, thou!'  he called over his shoulder.

'Not I,' said Kim'.  'I go round.'

'Come.  He does no hurt.'

Kim hesitated for a moment.  The lama backed his order by some droned
Chinese quotation which Kim took for a charm.  He obeyed and bounded
across the rivulet, and the snake, indeed, made no sign.

'Never have I seen such a man.'  Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead.
'And now, whither go we?'

'That is for thee to say.  I am old, and a stranger--far from my own
place.  But that the rail-carriage fills my head with noises of
devil-drums I would go in it to Benares now ...  Yet by so going we may
miss the River.  Let us find another river.'

Where the hard-worked soil gives three and even four crops a year
through patches of sugar-cane, tobacco, long white radishes, and
nol-kol, all that day they strolled on, turning aside to every glimpse
of water; rousing village dogs and sleeping villages at noonday; the
lama replying to the volleyed questions with an unswerving simplicity.
They sought a River:  a River of miraculous healing.  Had any one
knowledge of such a stream?

Sometimes men laughed, but more often heard the story out to the end
and offered them a place in the shade, a drink of milk, and a meal.
The women were always kind, and the little children as children are the
world over, alternately shy and venturesome.

Evening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud-walled,
mud-roofed hamlet, talking to the headman as the cattle came in from
the grazing-grounds and the women prepared the day's last meal.  They
had passed beyond the belt of market-gardens round hungry Umballa, and
were among the mile-wide green of the staple crops.

He was a white-bearded and affable elder, used to entertaining
strangers.  He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama, set warm
cooked food before him, prepared him a pipe, and, the evening
ceremonies being finished in the village temple, sent for the village
priest.

Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore, of
railway travel, and such-like city things, while the men talked, slowly
as their cattle chew the cud.

'I cannot fathom it,' said the headman at last to the priest. 'How
readest thou this talk?'  The lama, his tale told, was silently telling
his beads.

'He is a Seeker.'  the priest answered.  'The land is full of such.
Remember him who came only last, month--the fakir with the tortoise?'

'Ay, but that man had right and reason, for Krishna Himself appeared in
a vision promising him Paradise without the burning-pyre if he
journeyed to Prayag.  This man seeks no God who is within my knowledge.'

'Peace, he is old:  he comes from far off, and he is mad,' the
smooth-shaven priest replied.  'Hear me.'  He turned to the lama.
'Three koss [six miles] to the westward runs the great road to
Calcutta.'

'But I would go to Benares--to Benares.'

'And to Benares also.  It crosses all streams on this side of Hind.
Now my word to thee, Holy One, is rest here till tomorrow. Then take
the road' (it was the Grand Trunk Road he meant) 'and test each stream
that it overpasses; for, as I understand, the virtue of thy River lies
neither in one pool nor place, but throughout its length.  Then, if thy
Gods will, be assured that thou wilt come upon thy freedom.'

'That is well said.'  The lama was much impressed by the plan.  'We
will begin tomorrow, and a blessing on thee for showing old feet such a
near road.'  A deep, sing-song Chinese half-chant closed the sentence.
Even the priest was impressed, and the headman feared an evil spell:
but none could look at the lama's simple, eager face and doubt him long.

'Seest thou my chela?'  he said, diving into his snuff-gourd with an
important sniff.  It was his duty to repay courtesy with courtesy.

'I see--and hear.'  The headman rolled his eye where Kim was chatting
to a girl in blue as she laid crackling thorns on a fire.

'He also has a Search of his own.  No river, but a Bull.  Yea, a Red
Bull on a green field will some day raise him to honour.  He is, I
think, not altogether of this world.  He was sent of a sudden to aid me
in this search, and his name is Friend of all the World.'

The priest smiled.  'Ho, there, Friend of all the World,' he cried
across the sharp-smelling smoke, 'what art thou?'

'This Holy One's disciple,' said Kim.

'He says thou are a but [a spirit].'

'Can buts eat?'  said Kim, with a twinkle.  'For I am hungry.'

'It is no jest,' cried the lama.  'A certain astrologer of that city
whose name I have forgotten--'

'That is no more than the city of Umballa where we slept last night,'
Kim whispered to the priest.

'Ay, Umballa was it?  He cast a horoscope and declared that my chela
should find his desire within two days.  But what said he of the
meaning of the stars, Friend of all the World?'

Kim cleared his throat and looked around at the village greybeards.

'The meaning of my Star is War,' he replied pompously.

Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the
brickwork plinth under the great tree.  Where a native would have lain
down, Kim's white blood set him upon his feet.

'Ay, War,' he answered.

'That is a sure prophecy,' rumbled a deep voice.  'For there is always
war along the Border--as I know.'

It was an old, withered man, who had served the Government in the days
of the Mutiny as a native officer in a newly raised cavalry regiment.
The Government had given him a good holding in the village, and though
the demands of his sons, now grey-bearded officers on their own
account, had impoverished him, he was still a person of consequence.
English officials--Deputy Commissioners even--turned aside from the
main road to visit him, and on those occasions he dressed himself in
the uniform of ancient days, and stood up like a ramrod.

'But this shall be a great war--a war of eight thousand.'  Kim's voice
shrilled across the quick-gathering crowd, astonishing himself.

'Redcoats or our own regiments?'  the old man snapped, as though he
were asking an equal.  His tone made men respect Kim.

'Redcoats,' said Kim at a venture.  'Redcoats and guns.'

'But--but the astrologer said no word of this,' cried the lama,
snuffing prodigiously in his excitement.

'But I know.  The word has come to me, who am this Holy One's disciple.
There will rise a war--a war of eight thousand redcoats. From Pindi and
Peshawur they will be drawn.  This is sure.'

'The boy has heard bazar-talk,' said the priest.

'But he was always by my side,' said the lama.  'How should he know? I
did not know.'

'He will make a clever juggler when the old man is dead,' muttered the
priest to the headman.  'What new trick is this?'

'A sign.  Give me a sign,' thundered the old soldier suddenly.  'If
there were war my sons would have told me.'

'When all is ready, thy sons, doubt not, will be told.  But it is a
long road from thy sons to the man in whose hands these things lie.'
Kim warmed to the game, for it reminded him of experiences in the
letter-carrying line, when, for the sake of a few pice, he pretended to
know more than he knew.  But now he was playing for larger things--the
sheer excitement and the sense of power.  He drew a new breath and went
on.

'Old man, give me a sign.  Do underlings order the goings of eight
thousand redcoats--with guns?'

'No.'  Still the old man answered as though Kim were an equal.

'Dost thou know who He is, then, that gives the order?'

'I have seen Him.'

'To know again?'

'I have known Him since he was a lieutenant in the topkhana (the
Artillery).'

'A tall man.  A tall man with black hair, walking thus?'  Kim took a
few paces in a stiff, wooden style.

'Ay.  But that anyone may have seen.'  The crowd were breathless--still
through all this talk.

'That is true,' said Kim.  'But I will say more.  Look now.  First the
great man walks thus.  Then He thinks thus.'  (Kim drew a forefinger
over his forehead and downwards till it came to rest by the angle of
the jaw.) 'Anon He twitches his fingers thus. Anon He thrusts his hat
under his left armpit.'  Kim illustrated the motion and stood like a
stork.

The old man groaned, inarticulate with amazement; and the crowd
shivered.

'So--so--so.  But what does He when He is about to give an order?'

'He rubs the skin at the back of his neck--thus.  Then falls one finger
on the table and He makes a small sniffing noise through his nose.
Then He speaks, saying:  "Loose such and such a regiment. Call out such
guns."'

The old man rose stiffly and saluted.

'"For"'--Kim translated into the vernacular the clinching sentences he
had heard in the dressing-room at Umballa--'"For," says He, "we should
have done this long ago.  It is not war--it is a chastisement.  Snff!"'

'Enough.  I believe.  I have seen Him thus in the smoke of battles.
Seen and heard.  It is He!'

'I saw no smoke'--Kim's voice shifted to the rapt sing-song of the
wayside fortune-teller.  'I saw this in darkness.  First came a man to
make things clear.  Then came horsemen.  Then came He standing in a
ring of light.  The rest followed as I have said.  Old man, have I
spoken truth?'

'It is He.  Past all doubt it is He.'

The crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring alternately at the old
man, still at attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight.

'Said I not--said I not he was from the other world?'  cried the lama
proudly.  'He is the Friend of all the World.  He is the Friend of the
Stars!'

'At least it does not concern us,' a man cried.  'O thou young
soothsayer, if the gift abides with thee at all seasons, I have a
red-spotted cow.  She may be sister to thy Bull for aught I know--'

'Or I care,' said Kim.  'My Stars do not concern themselves with thy
cattle.'

'Nay, but she is very sick,' a woman struck in.  'My man is a buffalo,
or he would have chosen his words better.  Tell me if she recover?'

Had Kim been at all an ordinary boy, he would have carried on the play;
but one does not know Lahore city, and least of all the fakirs by the
Taksali Gate, for thirteen years without also knowing human nature.

The priest looked at him sideways, something bitterly--a dry and
blighting smile.

'Is there no priest, then, in the village?  I thought I had seen a
great one even now,' cried Kim.

'Ay--but--' the woman began.

'But thou and thy husband hoped to get the cow cured for a handful of
thanks.'  The shot told:  they were notoriously the closest-fisted
couple in the village.  'It is not well to cheat the temples.  Give a
young calf to thine own priest, and, unless thy Gods are angry past
recall, she will give milk within a month.'

'A master-beggar art thou,' purred the priest approvingly.  'Not the
cunning of forty years could have done better.  Surely thou hast made
the old man rich?'

'A little flour, a little butter and a mouthful of cardamoms,' Kim
retorted, flushed with the praise, but still cautious--'Does one grow
rich on that?  And, as thou canst see, he is mad.  But it serves me
while I learn the road at least.'

He knew what the fakirs of the Taksali Gate were like when they talked
among themselves, and copied the very inflection of their lewd
disciples.

'Is his Search, then, truth or a cloak to other ends?  It may be
treasure.'

'He is mad--many times mad.  There is nothing else.'

Here the old soldier bobbled up and asked if Kim would accept his
hospitality for the night.  The priest recommended him to do so, but
insisted that the honour of entertaining the lama belonged to the
temple--at which the lama smiled guilelessly.  Kim glanced from one
face to the other, and drew his own conclusions.

'Where is the money?'  he whispered, beckoning the old man off into the
darkness.

'In my bosom.  Where else?'

'Give it me.  Quietly and swiftly give it me.'

'But why?  Here is no ticket to buy.'

'Am I thy chela, or am I not?  Do I not safeguard thy old feet about
the ways?  Give me the money and at dawn I will return it.'  He slipped
his hand above the lama's girdle and brought away the purse.

'Be it so--be it so.'  The old man nodded his head.  'This is a great
and terrible world.  I never knew there were so many men alive in it.'

Next morning the priest was in a very bad temper, but the lama was
quite happy; and Kim had enjoyed a most interesting evening with the
old man, who brought out his cavalry sabre and, balancing it on his dry
knees, told tales of the Mutiny and young captains thirty years in
their graves, till Kim dropped off to sleep.

'Certainly the air of this country is good,' said the lama.  'I sleep
lightly, as do all old men; but last night I slept unwaking till broad
day.  Even now I am heavy.'

'Drink a draught of hot milk,' said Kim, who had carried not a few such
remedies to opium-smokers of his acquaintance.  'It is time to take the
Road again.'

'The long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,' said the lama
gaily.  'Let us go.  But how thinkest thou, chela, to recompense these
people, and especially the priest, for their great kindness? Truly they
are but parast, but in other lives, maybe, they will receive
enlightenment.  A rupee to the temple?  The thing within is no more
than stone and red paint, but the heart of man we must acknowledge when
and where it is good.'

'Holy One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?'  Kim looked up
sharply, like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.

'Surely, child:  from Kulu to Pathankot--from Kulu, where my first
chela died.  When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all men
were well-disposed throughout all the Hills.'

'It is otherwise in Hind,' said Kim drily.  'Their Gods are many-armed
and malignant.  Let them alone.'

'I would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World,
thou and thy yellow man.'  The old soldier ambled up the village
street, all shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked pony. 'Last
night broke up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and
it was as a blessing to me.  Truly there is war abroad in the air.  I
smell it.  See!  I have brought my sword.'

He sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his
side--hand dropped on the pommel--staring fiercely over the flat lands
towards the North.  'Tell me again how He showed in thy vision.  Come
up and sit behind me.  The beast will carry two.'

'I am this Holy One's disciple,' said Kim, as they cleared the
village-gate.  The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but
the priest's farewell was cold and distant.  He had wasted some opium
on a man who carried no money.

'That is well spoken.  I am not much used to holy men, but respect is
always good.  There is no respect in these days--not even when a
Commissioner Sahib comes to see me.  But why should one whose Star
leads him to war follow a holy man?'

'But he is a holy man,' said Kim earnestly.  'In truth, and in talk and
in act, holy.  He is not like the others.  I have never seen such an
one.  We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.'

'Thou art not.  That I can see.  But I do not know that other.  He
marches well, though.'

The first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long,
easy, camel-like strides.  He was deep in meditation, mechanically
clicking his rosary.

They followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the
flat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the
snowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward.  All India was at work in
the fields, to the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen
behind their cattle, and the clamour of the crows.  Even the pony felt
the good influence and almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on
the stirrup-leather.

'It repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,' said the
lama on the last bead of his eighty-one.

The old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first
time was aware of him.

'Seekest thou the River also?'  said he, turning.

'The day is new,' was the reply.  'What need of a river save to water
at before sundown?  I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road.'

'That is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will.  But why the
sword?'

The old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of
make-believe.

'The sword,' he said, fumbling it.  'Oh, that was a fancy of mine an
old man's fancy.  Truly the police orders are that no man must bear
weapons throughout Hind, but'--he cheered up and slapped the hilt--'all
the constabeels hereabout know me.'

'It is not a good fancy,' said the lama.  'What profit to kill men?'

'Very little--as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain it
would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers.  I do not speak
without knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with
blood.'

'What madness was that, then?'

'The Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know.  A madness ate into
all the Army, and they turned against their officers.  That was the
first evil, but not past remedy if they had then held their hands.  But
they chose to kill the Sahibs' wives and children.  Then came the
Sahibs from over the sea and called them to most strict account.'

'Some such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago.  They called it
the Black Year, as I remember.'

'What manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year?  A rumour
indeed!  All earth knew, and trembled!'

'Our earth never shook but once--upon the day that the Excellent One
received Enlightenment.'

'Umph!  I saw Delhi shake at least--and Delhi is the navel of the
world.'

'So they turned against women and children?  That was a bad deed, for
which the punishment cannot be avoided.'

'Many strove to do so, but with very small profit.  I was then in a
regiment of cavalry.  It broke.  Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood
fast to their salt--how many, think you?  Three.  Of whom I was one.'

'The greater merit.'

'Merit!  We did not consider it merit in those days.  My people, my
friends, my brothers fell from me.  They said:  "The time of the
English is accomplished.  Let each strike out a little holding for
himself."  But I had talked with the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah,
of Moodkee and Ferozeshah.  I said:  "Abide a little and the wind
turns.  There is no blessing in this work."  In those days I rode
seventy miles with an English Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow.
(Wow!  That was a horse fit for a man!) I placed them in safety, and
back came I to my officer--the one that was not killed of our five.
"Give me work," said I, "for I am an outcast among my own kind, and my
cousin's blood is wet on my sabre."  "Be content," said he.  "There is
great work forward.  When this madness is over there is a recompense."'

'Ay, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?'  the lama
muttered half to himself.

'They did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had
heard a gun fired.  No!  In nineteen pitched battles was I; in
six-and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without number.
Nine wounds I bear; a medal and four clasps and the medal of an Order,
for my captains, who are now generals, remembered me when the
Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign, and all the
land rejoiced.  They said:  "Give him the Order of Berittish India."  I
carry it upon my neck now.  I have also my jaghir [holding] from the
hands of the State--a free gift to me and mine. The men of the old
days--they are now Commissioners--come riding to me through the
crops--high upon horses so that all the village sees--and we talk out
the old skirmishes, one dead man's name leading to another.'

'And after?'  said the lama.

'Oh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.'

'And at the last what wilt thou do?'

'At the last I shall die.'

'And after?'

'Let the Gods order it.  I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do
not think They will pester me.  Look you, I have noticed in my long
life that those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints
and reports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in
haste, as our Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who
talked too much.  No, I have never wearied the Gods.  They will
remember this, and give me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in
the shade, and wait to welcome my sons:  I have no less than three
Rissaldar--majors all--in the regiments.'

'And they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to
life--from despair to despair,' said the lama below his breath, 'hot,
uneasy, snatching.'

'Ay,' the old soldier chuckled.  'Three Rissaldar--majors in three
regiments.  Gamblers a little, but so am I. They must be well mounted;
and one cannot take the horses as in the old days one took women.
Well, well, my holding can pay for all.  How thinkest thou? It is a
well-watered strip, but my men cheat me.  I do not know how to ask save
at the lance's point.  Ugh!  I grow angry and I curse them, and they
feign penitence, but behind my back I know they call me a toothless old
ape.'

'Hast thou never desired any other thing?'

'Yes--yes--a thousand times!  A straight back and a close-clinging knee
once more; a quick wrist and a keen eye; and the marrow that makes a
man.  Oh, the old days--the good days of my strength!'

'That strength is weakness.'

'It has turned so; but fifty years since I could have proved it
otherwise,' the old soldier retorted, driving his stirrup-edge into the
pony's lean flank.

'But I know a River of great healing.'

'I have drank Gunga-water to the edge of dropsy.  All she gave me was a
flux, and no sort of strength.'

'It is not Gunga.  The River that I know washes from all taint of sin.
Ascending the far bank one is assured of Freedom.  I do not know thy
life, but thy face is the face of the honourable and courteous.  Thou
hast clung to thy Way, rendering fidelity when it was hard to give, in
that Black Year of which I now remember other tales.  Enter now upon
the Middle Way which is the path to Freedom.  Hear the Most Excellent
Law, and do not follow dreams.'

'Speak, then, old man,' the soldier smiled, half saluting.  'We be all
babblers at our age.'

The lama squatted under the shade of a mango, whose shadow played
checkerwise over his face; the soldier sat stiffly on the pony; and
Kim, making sure that there were no snakes, lay down in the crotch of
the twisted roots.

There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine, a cooing of
doves, and a sleepy drone of well-wheels across the fields. Slowly and
impressively the lama began.  At the end of ten minutes the old soldier
slid from his pony, to hear better as he said, and sat with the reins
round his wrist.  The lama's voice faltered, the periods lengthened.
Kim was busy watching a grey squirrel. When the little scolding bunch
of fur, close pressed to the branch, disappeared, preacher and audience
were fast asleep, the old officer's strong-cut head pillowed on his
arm, the lama's thrown back against the tree-bole, where it showed like
yellow ivory.  A naked child toddled up, stared, and, moved by some
quick impulse of reverence, made a solemn little obeisance before the
lama--only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over
sideways, and Kim laughed at the sprawling, chubby legs.  The child,
scared and indignant, yelled aloud.

'Hai!  Hai!'  said the soldier, leaping to his feet.  'What is it? What
orders?  ...  It is ...  a child!  I dreamed it was an alarm. Little
one--little one--do not cry.  Have I slept?  That was discourteous
indeed!'

'I fear!  I am afraid!'  roared the child.

'What is it to fear?  Two old men and a boy?  How wilt thou ever make a
soldier, Princeling?'

The lama had waked too, but, taking no direct notice of the child,
clicked his rosary.

'What is that?'  said the child, stopping a yell midway.  'I have never
seen such things.  Give them me.'

'Aha.'  said the lama, smiling, and trailing a loop of it on the grass:

This is a handful of cardamoms, This is a lump of ghi: This is millet
and chillies and rice, A supper for thee and me!

The child shrieked with joy, and snatched at the dark, glancing beads.

'Oho!'  said the old soldier.  'Whence hadst thou that song, despiser
of this world?'

'I learned it in Pathankot--sitting on a doorstep,' said the lama
shyly.  'It is good to be kind to babes.'

'As I remember, before the sleep came on us, thou hadst told me that
marriage and bearing were darkeners of the true light, stumbling-blocks
upon the Way.  Do children drop from Heaven in thy country?  Is it the
Way to sing them songs?'

'No man is all perfect,' said the lama gravely, recoiling the rosary.
'Run now to thy mother, little one.'

'Hear him!'  said the soldier to Kim.  'He is ashamed for that he has
made a child happy.  There was a very good householder lost in thee, my
brother.  Hai, child!'  He threw it a pice.  'Sweetmeats are always
sweet.'  And as the little figure capered away into the sunshine: 'They
grow up and become men.  Holy One, I grieve that I slept in the midst
of thy preaching.  Forgive me.'

'We be two old men,' said the lama.  'The fault is mine.  I listened to
thy talk of the world and its madness, and one fault led to the next.'

'Hear him!  What harm do thy Gods suffer from play with a babe?  And
that song was very well sung.  Let us go on and I will sing thee the
song of Nikal Seyn before Delhi--the old song.'

And they fared out from the gloom of the mango tope, the old man's
high, shrill voice ringing across the field, as wail by long-drawn wail
he unfolded the story of Nikal Seyn [Nicholson]--the song that men sing
in the Punjab to this day.  Kim was delighted, and the lama listened
with deep interest.

'Ahi!  Nikal Seyn is dead--he died before Delhi!  Lances of the North,
take vengeance for Nikal Seyn.'  He quavered it out to the end, marking
the trills with the flat of his sword on the pony's rump.

'And now we come to the Big Road,' said he, after receiving the
compliments of Kim; for the lama was markedly silent.  'It is long
since I have ridden this way, but thy boy's talk stirred me.  See, Holy
One--the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind.  For the most
part it is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees; the middle
road--all hard--takes the quick traffic.  In the days before
rail-carriages the Sahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds. Now
there are only country-carts and such like.  Left and right is the
rougher road for the heavy carts--grain and cotton and timber, fodder,
lime and hides.  A man goes in safety here for at every few koss is a
police-station.  The police are thieves and extortioners (I myself
would patrol it with cavalry--young recruits under a strong captain),
but at least they do not suffer any rivals.  All castes and kinds of
men move here.

'Look!  Brahmins and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias,
pilgrims and potters--all the world going and coming.  It is to me as a
river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood.'

And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle.  It runs
straight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred
miles--such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world.  They
looked at the green-arched, shade-flecked length of it, the white
breadth speckled with slow-pacing folk; and the two-roomed
police-station opposite.

'Who bears arms against the law?'  a constable called out laughingly,
as he caught sight of the soldier's sword.  'Are not the police enough
to destroy evil-doers?'

'It was because of the police I bought it,' was the answer.  'Does all
go well in Hind?'

'Rissaldar Sahib, all goes well.'

'I am like an old tortoise, look you, who puts his head out from the
bank and draws it in again.  Ay, this is the Road of Hindustan. All men
come by this way...'

'Son of a swine, is the soft part of the road meant for thee to scratch
thy back upon?  Father of all the daughters of shame and husband of ten
thousand virtueless ones, thy mother was devoted to a devil, being led
thereto by her mother.  Thy aunts have never had a nose for seven
generations!  Thy sister--What Owl's folly told thee to draw thy carts
across the road?  A broken wheel?  Then take a broken head and put the
two together at leisure!'

The voice and a venomous whip-cracking came out of a pillar of dust
fifty yards away, where a cart had broken down.  A thin, high Kathiawar
mare, with eyes and nostrils aflame, rocketed out of the jam, snorting
and wincing as her rider bent her across the road in chase of a
shouting man.  He was tall and grey-bearded, sitting the almost mad
beast as a piece of her, and scientifically lashing his victim between
plunges.

The old man's face lit with pride.  'My child!'  said he briefly, and
strove to rein the pony's neck to a fitting arch.

'Am I to be beaten before the police?'  cried the carter.  'Justice! I
will have Justice--'

'Am I to be blocked by a shouting ape who upsets ten thousand sacks
under a young horse's nose?  That is the way to ruin a mare.'

'He speaks truth.  He speaks truth.  But she follows her man close,'
said the old man.  The carter ran under the wheels of his cart and
thence threatened all sorts of vengeance.

'They are strong men, thy sons,' said the policeman serenely, picking
his teeth.

The horseman delivered one last vicious cut with his whip and came on
at a canter.

'My father!'  He reigned back ten yards and dismounted.

The old man was off his pony in an instant, and they embraced as do
father and son in the East.




Chapter 4


  Good Luck, she is never a lady,
  But the cursedest quean alive,
  Tricksy, wincing, and jady--
  Kittle to lead or drive.
  Greet her--she's hailing a stranger!
  Meet her--she's busking to leave!
  Let her alone for a shrew to the bone
  And the hussy comes plucking your sleeve!
  Largesse!  Largesse, O Fortune!
  Give or hold at your will.
  If I've no care for Fortune,
  Fortune must follow me still!

  The Wishing-Caps.


Then, lowering their voices, they spoke together.  Kim came to rest
under a tree, but the lama tugged impatiently at his elbow.

'Let us go on.  The River is not here.'

'Hai mai!  Have we not walked enough for a little?  Our River will not
run away.  Patience, and he will give us a dole.'

'This.'  said the old soldier suddenly, 'is the Friend of the Stars. He
brought me the news yesterday.  Having seen the very man Himself, in a
vision, giving orders for the war.'

'Hm!'  said his son, all deep in his broad chest.  'He came by a
bazar-rumour and made profit of it.'

His father laughed.  'At least he did not ride to me begging for a new
charger, and the Gods know how many rupees.  Are thy brothers'
regiments also under orders?'

'I do not know.  I took leave and came swiftly to thee in case--'

'In case they ran before thee to beg.  O gamblers and spendthrifts all!
But thou hast never yet ridden in a charge.  A good horse is needed
there, truly.  A good follower and a good pony also for the marching.
Let us see--let us see.'  He thrummed on the pommel.

'This is no place to cast accounts in, my father.  Let us go to thy
house.'

'At least pay the boy, then:  I have no pice with me, and he brought
auspicious news.  Ho!  Friend of all the World, a war is toward as thou
hast said.'

'Nay, as I know, the war,' returned Kim composedly.

'Eh?'  said the lama, fingering his beads, all eager for the road.

'My master does not trouble the Stars for hire.  We brought the news
bear witness, we brought the news, and now we go.'  Kim half-crooked
his hand at his side.

The son tossed a silver coin through the sunlight, grumbling something
about beggars and jugglers.  It was a four-anna piece, and would feed
them well for days.  The lama, seeing the flash of the metal, droned a
blessing.

'Go thy way, Friend of all the World,' piped the old soldier, wheeling
his scrawny mount.  'For once in all my days I have met a true
prophet--who was not in the Army.'

Father and son swung round together:  the old man sitting as erect as
the younger.

A Punjabi constable in yellow linen trousers slouched across the road.
He had seen the money pass.

'Halt!'  he cried in impressive English.  'Know ye not that there is a
takkus of two annas a head, which is four annas, on those who enter the
Road from this side-road?  It is the order of the Sirkar, and the money
is spent for the planting of trees and the beautification of the ways.'

'And the bellies of the police,' said Kim, slipping out of arm's reach.
'Consider for a while, man with a mud head.  Think you we came from the
nearest pond like the frog, thy father-in-law?  Hast thou ever heard
the name of thy brother?'

'And who was he?  Leave the boy alone,' cried a senior constable,
immensely delighted, as he squatted down to smoke his pipe in the
veranda.

'He took a label from a bottle of belaitee-pani [soda-water], and,
affixing it to a bridge, collected taxes for a month from those who
passed, saying that it was the Sirkar's order.  Then came an Englishman
and broke his head.  Ah, brother, I am a town-crow, not a village-crow!'

The policeman drew back abashed, and Kim hooted at him all down the
road.

'Was there ever such a disciple as I?' he cried merrily to the lama.
'All earth would have picked thy bones within ten mile of Lahore city
if I had not guarded thee.'

'I consider in my own mind whether thou art a spirit, sometimes, or
sometimes an evil imp,' said the lama, smiling slowly.

'I am thy chela.'  Kim dropped into step at his side--that
indescribable gait of the long-distance tramp all the world over.

'Now let us walk,' muttered the lama, and to the click of his rosary
they walked in silence mile upon mile.  The lama as usual, was deep in
meditation, but Kim's bright eyes were open wide.  This broad, smiling
river of life, he considered, was a vast improvement on the cramped and
crowded Lahore streets.  There were new people and new sights at every
stride--castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his
experience.

They met a troop of long-haired, strong-scented Sansis with baskets of
lizards and other unclean food on their backs, their lean dogs sniffing
at their heels.  These people kept their own side of the road', moving
at a quick, furtive jog-trot, and all other castes gave them ample
room; for the Sansi is deep pollution.  Behind them, walking wide and
stiffly across the strong shadows, the memory of his leg-irons still on
him, strode one newly released from the jail; his full stomach and
shiny skin to prove that the Government fed its prisoners better than
most honest men could feed themselves.  Kim knew that walk well, and
made broad jest of it as they passed.  Then an Akali, a wild-eyed,
wild-haired Sikh devotee in the blue-checked clothes of his faith, with
polished-steel quoits glistening on the cone of his tall blue turban,
stalked past, returning from a visit to one of the independent Sikh
States, where he had been singing the ancient glories of the Khalsa to
College-trained princelings in top-boots and white-cord breeches. Kim
was careful not to irritate that man; for the Akali's temper is short
and his arm quick.  Here and there they met or were overtaken by the
gaily dressed crowds of whole villages turning out to some local fair;
the women, with their babes on their hips, walking behind the men, the
older boys prancing on sticks of sugar-cane, dragging rude brass models
of locomotives such as they sell for a halfpenny, or flashing the sun
into the eyes of their betters from cheap toy mirrors.  One could see
at a glance what each had bought; and if there were any doubt it needed
only to watch the wives comparing, brown arm against brown arm, the
newly purchased dull glass bracelets that come from the North-West.
These merry-makers stepped slowly, calling one to the other and
stopping to haggle with sweetmeat-sellers, or to make a prayer before
one of the wayside shrines--sometimes Hindu, sometimes Mussalman--which
the low-caste of both creeds share with beautiful impartiality.  A
solid line of blue, rising and falling like the back of a caterpillar
in haste, would swing up through the quivering dust and trot past to a
chorus of quick cackling.  That was a gang of changars--the women who
have taken all the embankments of all the Northern railways under their
charge--a flat-footed, big-bosomed, strong-limbed, blue-petticoated
clan of earth-carriers, hurrying north on news of a job, and wasting no
time by the road.  They belong to the caste whose men do not count, and
they walked with squared elbows, swinging hips, and heads on high, as
suits women who carry heavy weights.  A little later a marriage
procession would strike into the Grand Trunk with music and shoutings,
and a smell of marigold and jasmine stronger even than the reek of the
dust.  One could see the bride's litter, a blur of red and tinsel,
staggering through the haze, while the bridegroom's bewreathed pony
turned aside to snatch a mouthful from a passing fodder-cart.  Then Kim
would join the Kentish-fire of good wishes and bad jokes, wishing the
couple a hundred sons and no daughters, as the saying is.  Still more
interesting and more to be shouted over it was when a strolling juggler
with some half-trained monkeys, or a panting, feeble bear, or a woman
who tied goats' horns to her feet, and with these danced on a
slack-rope, set the horses to shying and the women to shrill,
long-drawn quavers of amazement.

The lama never raised his eyes.  He did not note the money-lender on
his goose-rumped pony, hastening along to collect the cruel interest;
or the long-shouting, deep-voiced little mob--still in military
formation--of native soldiers on leave, rejoicing to be rid of their
breeches and puttees, and saying the most outrageous things to the most
respectable women in sight.  Even the seller of Ganges-water he did not
see, and Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that
precious stuff.  He looked steadily at the ground, and strode as
steadily hour after hour, his soul busied elsewhere.  But Kim was in
the seventh heaven of joy.  The Grand Trunk at this point was built on
an embankment to guard against winter floods from the foothills, so
that one walked, as it were, a little above the country, along a
stately corridor, seeing all India spread out to left and right.  It
was beautiful to behold the many-yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling
over the country roads: one could hear their axles, complaining a mile
away, coming nearer, till with shouts and yells and bad words they
climbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road,
carter reviling carter.  It was equally beautiful to watch the people,
little clumps of red and blue and pink and white and saffron, turning
aside to go to their own villages, dispersing and growing small by twos
and threes across the level plain.  Kim felt these things, though he
could not give tongue to his feelings, and so contented himself with
buying peeled sugar-cane and spitting the pith generously about his
path.  From time to time the lama took snuff, and at last Kim could
endure the silence no longer.

'This is a good land--the land of the South!'  said he.  'The air is
good; the water is good.  Eh?'

'And they are all bound upon the Wheel,' said the lama.  'Bound from
life after life.  To none of these has the Way been shown.'  He shook
himself back to this world.

'And now we have walked a weary way,' said Kim.  'Surely we shall soon
come to a parao [a resting-place].  Shall we stay there?  Look, the sun
is sloping.'

'Who will receive us this evening?'

'That is all one.  This country is full of good folk.  Besides' he sunk
his voice beneath a whisper--'we have money.'

The crowd thickened as they neared the resting-place which marked the
end of their day's journey.  A line of stalls selling very simple food
and tobacco, a stack of firewood, a police-station, a well, a
horse-trough, a few trees, and, under them, some trampled ground dotted
with the black ashes of old fires, are all that mark a parao on the
Grand Trunk; if you except the beggars and the crows--both hungry.

By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower
branches of the mango-trees; the parakeets and doves were coming home
in their hundreds; the chattering, grey-backed Seven Sisters, talking
over the day's adventures, walked back and forth in twos and threes
almost under the feet of the travellers; and shufflings and scufflings
in the branches showed that the bats were ready to go out on the
night-picket.  Swiftly the light gathered itself together, painted for
an instant the faces and the cartwheels and the bullocks' horns as red
as blood.  Then the night fell, changing the touch of the air, drawing
a low, even haze, like a gossamer veil of blue, across the face of the
country, and bringing out, keen and distinct, the smell of wood-smoke
and cattle and the good scent of wheaten cakes cooked on ashes.  The
evening patrol hurried out of the police-station with important
coughings and reiterated orders; and a live charcoal ball in the cup of
a wayside carter's hookah glowed red while Kim's eye mechanically
watched the last flicker of the sun on the brass tweezers.

The life of the parao was very like that of the Kashmir Serai on a
small scale.  Kim dived into the happy Asiatic disorder which, if you
only allow time, will bring you everything that a simple man needs.

His wants were few, because, since the lama had no caste scruples,
cooked food from the nearest stall would serve; but, for luxury's sake,
Kim bought a handful of dung-cakes to build a fire.  All about, coming
and going round the little flames, men cried for oil, or grain, or
sweetmeats, or tobacco, jostling one another while they waited their
turn at the well; and under the men's voices you heard from halted,
shuttered carts the high squeals and giggles of women whose faces
should not be seen in public.

Nowadays, well-educated natives are of opinion that when their
womenfolk travel--and they visit a good deal--it is better to take them
quickly by rail in a properly screened compartment; and that custom is
spreading.  But there are always those of the old rock who hold by the
use of their forefathers; and, above all, there are always the old
women--more conservative than the men--who toward the end of their days
go on a pilgrimage.  They, being withered and undesirable, do not,
under certain circumstances, object to unveiling.  After their long
seclusion, during which they have always been in business touch with a
thousand outside interests, they love the bustle and stir of the open
road, the gatherings at the shrines, and the infinite possibilities of
gossip with like-minded dowagers.  Very often it suits a longsuffering
family that a strong-tongued, iron-willed old lady should disport
herself about India in this fashion; for certainly pilgrimage is
grateful to the Gods.  So all about India, in the most remote places,
as in the most public, you find some knot of grizzled servitors in
nominal charge of an old lady who is more or less curtained and hid
away in a bullock-cart.  Such men are staid and discreet, and when a
European or a high-caste native is near will net their charge with most
elaborate precautions; but in the ordinary haphazard chances of
pilgrimage the precautions are not taken.  The old lady is, after all,
intensely human, and lives to look upon life.

Kim marked down a gaily ornamented ruth or family bullock-cart, with a
broidered canopy of two domes, like a double-humped camel, which had
just been drawn into the par.  Eight men made its retinue, and two of
the eight were armed with rusty sabres--sure signs that they followed a
person of distinction, for the common folk do not bear arms.  An
increasing cackle of complaints, orders, and jests, and what to a
European would have been bad language, came from behind the curtains.
Here was evidently a woman used to command.

Kim looked over the retinue critically.  Half of them were thin-legged,
grey-bearded Ooryas from down country.  The other half were
duffle-clad, felt-hatted hillmen of the North; and that mixture told
its own tale, even if he had not overheard the incessant sparring
between the two divisions.  The old lady was going south on a
visit--probably to a rich relative, most probably to a son-in-law, who
had sent up an escort as a mark of respect.  The hillmen would be of
her own people--Kulu or Kangra folk.  It was quite clear that she was
not taking her daughter down to be wedded, or the curtains would have
been laced home and the guard would have allowed no one near the car.
A merry and a high-spirited dame, thought Kim, balancing the dung-cake
in one hand, the cooked food in the other, and piloting the lama with a
nudging shoulder. Something might be made out of the meeting.  The lama
would give him no help, but, as a conscientious chela, Kim was
delighted to beg for two.

He built his fire as close to the cart as he dared, waiting for one of
the escort to order him away.  The lama dropped wearily to the ground,
much as a heavy fruit-eating bat cowers, and returned to his rosary.

'Stand farther off, beggar!'  The order was shouted in broken
Hindustani by one of the hillmen.

'Huh!  It is only a pahari [a hillman]', said Kim over his shoulder.
'Since when have the hill-asses owned all Hindustan?'

The retort was a swift and brilliant sketch of Kim's pedigree for three
generations.

'Ah!'  Kim's voice was sweeter than ever, as he broke the dung-cake
into fit pieces.  'In my country we call that the beginning of
love-talk.'

A harsh, thin cackle behind the curtains put the hillman on his mettle
for a second shot.

'Not so bad--not so bad,' said Kim with calm.  'But have a care, my
brother, lest we--we, I say--be minded to give a curse or so in return.
And our curses have the knack of biting home.'

The Ooryas laughed; the hillman sprang forward threateningly.  The lama
suddenly raised his head, bringing his huge tam-o'-shanter hat into the
full light of Kim's new-started fire.

'What is it?'  said he.

The man halted as though struck to stone.  'I--I--am saved from a great
sin,' he stammered.

'The foreigner has found him a priest at last,' whispered one of the
Ooryas.

'Hai!  Why is that beggar-brat not well beaten?'  the old woman cried.

The hillman drew back to the cart and whispered something to the
curtain.  There was dead silence, then a muttering.

'This goes well,' thought Kim, pretending neither to see nor hear.

'When--when--he has eaten'--the hillman fawned on Kim--'it--it is
requested that the Holy One will do the honour to talk to one who would
speak to him.'

'After he has eaten he will sleep,' Kim returned loftily.  He could not
quite see what new turn the game had taken, but stood resolute to
profit by it.  'Now I will get him his food.'  The last sentence,
spoken loudly, ended with a sigh as of faintness.

'I--I myself and the others of my people will look to that--if it is
permitted.'

'It is permitted,' said Kim, more loftily than ever.  'Holy One, these
people will bring us food.'

'The land is good.  All the country of the South is good--a great and a
terrible world,' mumbled the lama drowsily.

'Let him sleep,' said Kim, 'but look to it that we are well fed when he
wakes.  He is a very holy man.'

Again one of the Ooryas said something contemptuously.

'He is not a fakir.  He is not a down-country beggar,' Kim went on
severely, addressing the stars.  'He is the most holy of holy men. He
is above all castes.  I am his chela.'

'Come here!'  said the flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim
came, conscious that eyes he could not see were staring at him.  One
skinny brown finger heavy with rings lay on the edge of the cart, and
the talk went this way:

'Who is that one?'

'An exceedingly holy one.  He comes from far off.  He comes from Tibet.'

'Where in Tibet?'

'From behind the snows--from a very far place.  He knows the stars; he
makes horoscopes; he reads nativities.  But he does not do this for
money.  He does it for kindness and great charity.  I am his disciple.
I am called also the Friend of the Stars.'

'Thou art no hillman.'

'Ask him.  He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show
him an end to his pilgrimage.'

'Humph!  Consider, brat, that I am an old woman and not altogether a
fool.  Lamas I know, and to these I give reverence, but thou art no
more a lawful chela than this my finger is the pole of this wagon. Thou
art a casteless Hindu--a bold and unblushing beggar, attached, belike,
to the Holy One for the sake of gain.'

'Do we not all work for gain?'  Kim changed his tone promptly to match
that altered voice.  'I have heard'--this was a bow drawn at a
venture--'I have heard--'

'What hast thou heard?'  she snapped, rapping with the finger.

'Nothing that I well remember, but some talk in the bazars, which is
doubtless a lie, that even Rajahs--small Hill Rajahs--'

'But none the less of good Rajput blood.'

'Assuredly of good blood.  That these even sell the more comely of
their womenfolk for gain.  Down south they sell them--to zemindars and
such--all of Oudh.'

If there be one thing in the world that the small Hill Rajahs deny it
is just this charge; but it happens to be one thing that the bazars
believe, when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India.  The
old lady explained to Kim, in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely
what manner and fashion of malignant liar he was.  Had Kim hinted this
when she was a girl, he would have been pommelled to death that same
evening by an elephant.  This was perfectly true.

'Ahai!  I am only a beggar's brat, as the Eye of Beauty has said,' he
wailed in extravagant terror.

'Eye of Beauty, forsooth!  Who am I that thou shouldst fling
beggar-endearments at me?'  And yet she laughed at the long-forgotten
word.  'Forty years ago that might have been said, and not without
truth.  Ay.  thirty years ago.  But it is the fault of this gadding up
and down Hind that a king's widow must jostle all the scum of the land,
and be made a mock by beggars.'

'Great Queen,' said Kim promptly, for he heard her shaking with
indignation, 'I am even what the Great Queen says I am; but none the
less is my master holy.  He has not yet heard the Great Queen's order
that--'

'Order?  I order a Holy One--a Teacher of the Law--to come and speak to
a woman?  Never!'

'Pity my stupidity.  I thought it was given as an order--'

'It was not.  It was a petition.  Does this make all clear?'

A silver coin clicked on the edge of the cart.  Kim took it and
salaamed profoundly.  The old lady recognized that, as the eyes and the
ears of the lama, he was to be propitiated.

'I am but the Holy One's disciple.  When he has eaten perhaps he will
come.'

'Oh, villain and shameless rogue!'  The jewelled forefinger shook
itself at him reprovingly; but he could hear the old lady's chuckle.

'Nay, what is it?'  he said, dropping into his most caressing and
confidential tone--the one, he well knew, that few could resist.
'Is--is there any need of a son in thy family?  Speak freely, for we
priests--' That last was a direct plagiarism from a fakir by the
Taksali Gate.

'We priests!  Thou art not yet old enough to--' She checked the joke
with another laugh.  'Believe me, now and again, we women, O priest,
think of other matters than sons.  Moreover, my daughter has borne her
man-child.'

'Two arrows in the quiver are better than one; and three are better
still.'  Kim quoted the proverb with a meditative cough, looking
discreetly earthward.

'True--oh, true.  But perhaps that will come.  Certainly those
down-country Brahmins are utterly useless.  I sent gifts and monies and
gifts again to them, and they prophesied.'

'Ah,' drawled Kim, with infinite contempt, 'they prophesied!'  A
professional could have done no better.

'And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were
heard.  I chose an auspicious hour, and--perhaps thy Holy One has heard
of the Abbot of the Lung-Cho lamassery.  It was to him I put the
matter, and behold in the due time all came about as I desired. The
Brahmin in the house of the father of my daughter's son has since said
that it was through his prayers--which is a little error that I will
explain to him when we reach our journey's end. And so afterwards I go
to Buddh Gaya, to make shraddha for the father of my children.'

'Thither go we.'

'Doubly auspicious,' chirruped the old lady.  'A second son at least!'

'O Friend of all the World!'  The lama had waked, and, simply as a
child bewildered in a strange bed, called for Kim.

'I come!  I come, Holy One!'  He dashed to the fire, where he found the
lama already surrounded by dishes of food, the hillmen visibly adoring
him and the Southerners looking sourly.

'Go back!  Withdraw!'  Kim cried.  'Do we eat publicly like dogs?' They
finished the meal in silence, each turned a little from the other, and
Kim topped it with a native-made cigarette.

'Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land? Here
is a virtuous and high-born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage, she
says, to Buddha Gay.  She it is sends us those dishes; and when thou
art well rested she would speak to thee.'

'Is this also thy work?'  The lama dipped deep into his snuff-gourd.

'Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began?' Kim's
eyes danced in his head as he blew the rank smoke through his nostrils
and stretched him on the dusty ground.  'Have I failed to oversee thy
comforts, Holy One?'

'A blessing on thee.'  The lama inclined his solemn head.  'I have
known many men in my so long life, and disciples not a few.  But to
none among men, if so be thou art woman-born, has my heart gone out as
it has to thee--thoughtful, wise, and courteous; but something of a
small imp.'

'And I have never seen such a priest as thou.'  Kim considered the
benevolent yellow face wrinkle by wrinkle.  'It is less than three days
since we took the road together, and it is as though it were a hundred
years.'

'Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered
thee some service.  Maybe'--he smiled--'I freed thee from a trap; or,
having caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened,
cast thee back into the river.'

'Maybe,' said Kim quietly.  He had heard this sort of speculation again
and again, from the mouths of many whom the English would not consider
imaginative.  'Now, as regards that woman in the bullock-cart.  I think
she needs a second son for her daughter.'

'That is no part of the Way,' sighed the lama.  'But at least she is
from the Hills.  Ah, the Hills, and the snow of the Hills!'

He rose and stalked to the cart.  Kim would have given his ears to come
too, but the lama did not invite him; and the few words he caught were
in an unknown tongue, for they spoke some common speech of the
mountains.  The woman seemed to ask questions which the lama turned
over in his mind before answering.  Now and again he heard the singsong
cadence of a Chinese quotation.  It was a strange picture that Kim
watched between drooped eyelids.  The lama, very straight and erect,
the deep folds of his yellow clothing slashed with black in the light
of the parao fires precisely as a knotted tree-trunk is slashed with
the shadows of the low sun, addressed a tinsel and lacquered ruth which
burned like a many-coloured jewel in the same uncertain light.  The
patterns on the gold-worked curtains ran up and down, melting and
reforming as the folds shook and quivered to the night wind; and when
the talk grew more earnest the jewelled forefinger snapped out little
sparks of light between the embroideries.  Behind the cart was a wall
of uncertain darkness speckled with little flames and alive with
half-caught forms and faces and shadows.  The voices of early evening
had settled down to one soothing hum whose deepest note was the steady
chumping of the bullocks above their chopped straw, and whose highest
was the tinkle of a Bengali dancing-girl's sitar.  Most men had eaten
and pulled deep at their gurgling, grunting hookahs, which in full
blast sound like bull-frogs.

At last the lama returned.  A hillman walked behind him with a wadded
cotton-quilt and spread it carefully by the fire.

'She deserves ten thousand grandchildren,' thought Kim.  'None the
less, but for me, those gifts would not have come.'

'A virtuous woman--and a wise one.'  The lama slackened off, joint by
joint, like a slow camel.  'The world is full of charity to those who
follow the Way.'  He flung a fair half of the quilt over Kim.

'And what said she?'  Kim rolled up in his share of it.

'She asked me many questions and propounded many problems--the most of
which were idle tales which she had heard from devil-serving priests
who pretend to follow the Way.  Some I answered, and some I said were
foolish.  Many wear the Robe, but few keep the Way.'

'True.  That is true.'  Kim used the thoughtful, conciliatory tone of
those who wish to draw confidences.

'But by her lights she is most right-minded.  She desires greatly that
we should go with her to Buddh Gaya; her road being ours, as I
understand, for many days' journey to the southward.'

'And?'

'Patience a little.  To this I said that my Search came before all
things.  She had heard many foolish legends, but this great truth of my
River she had never heard.  Such are the priests of the lower hills!
She knew the Abbot of Lung-Cho, but she did not know of my River--nor
the tale of the Arrow.'

'And?'

'I spoke therefore of the Search, and of the Way, and of matters that
were profitable; she desiring only that I should accompany her and make
prayer for a second son.'

'Aha!  "We women" do not think of anything save children,' said Kim
sleepily.

'Now, since our roads run together for a while, I do not see that we in
any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her--at least as
far as--I have forgotten the name of the city.'

'Ohe!'  said Kim, turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of the
Ooryas a few yards away.  'Where is your master's house?'

'A little behind Saharunpore, among the fruit gardens.'  He named the
village.

'That was the place,' said the lama.  'So far, at least, we can go with
her.'

'Flies go to carrion,' said the Oorya, in an abstracted voice.

'For the sick cow a crow; for the sick man a Brahmin.'  Kim breathed
the proverb impersonally to the shadow-tops of the trees overhead.

The Oorya grunted and held his peace.

'So then we go with her, Holy One?'

'Is there any reason against?  I can still step aside and try all the
rivers that the road overpasses.  She desires that I should come.  She
very greatly desires it.'

Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt.  When once that imperious old lady
had recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable
that she would be worth listening to.

He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb:  'The
husbands of the talkative have a great reward hereafter.'  Then Kim
heard him snuff thrice, and dozed off, still laughing.

The diamond-bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together. Kim
sat up and yawned, shook himself, and thrilled with delight. This was
seeing the world in real truth; this was life as he would have
it--bustling and shouting, the buckling of belts, and beating of
bullocks and creaking of wheels, lighting of fires and cooking of food,
and new sights at every turn of the approving eye.  The morning mist
swept off in a whorl of silver, the parrots shot away to some distant
river in shrieking green hosts:  all the well-wheels within ear-shot
went to work.  India was awake, and Kim was in the middle of it, more
awake and more excited than anyone, chewing on a twig that he would
presently use as a toothbrush; for he borrowed right- and left-handedly
from all the customs of the country he knew and loved.  There was no
need to worry about food--no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded
stalls.  He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong-willed
old lady.  All things would be prepared for them, and when they were
respectfully invited so to do they would sit and eat.  For the
rest--Kim giggled here as he cleaned his teeth--his hostess would
rather heighten the enjoyment of the road.  He inspected her bullocks
critically, as they came up grunting and blowing under the yokes.  If
they went too fast--it was not likely--there would be a pleasant seat
for himself along the pole; the lama would sit beside the driver.  The
escort, of course, would walk.  The old lady, equally of course, would
talk a great deal, and by what he had heard that conversation would not
lack salt.  She was already ordering, haranguing, rebuking, and, it
must be said, cursing her servants for delays.

'Get her her pipe.  In the name of the Gods, get her her pipe and stop
her ill-omened mouth,' cried an Oorya, tying up his shapeless bundles
of bedding.  'She and the parrots are alike.  They screech in the dawn.'

'The lead-bullocks!  Hai!  Look to the lead-bullocks!'  They were
backing and wheeling as a grain-cart's axle caught them by the horns.
'Son of an owl, where dost thou go?'  This to the grinning carter.

'Ai!  Yai!  Yai!  That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray
for a son,' the man called back over his high load.  'Room for the
Queen of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his
own sword!'  Another cart loaded with bark for a down-country tannery
followed close behind, and its driver added a few compliments as the
ruth-bullocks backed and backed again.

From behind the shaking curtains came one volley of invective.  It did
not last long, but in kind and quality, in blistering, biting
appropriateness, it was beyond anything that even Kim had heard.  He
could see the carter's bare chest collapse with amazement, as the man
salaamed reverently to the voice, leaped from the pole, and helped the
escort haul their volcano on to the main road.  Here the voice told him
truthfully what sort of wife he had wedded, and what she was doing in
his absence.

'Oh, shabash!'  murmured Kim, unable to contain himself, as the man
slunk away.

'Well done, indeed?  It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may
not go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by
all the refuse of Hindustan--that she must eat gali [abuse] as men eat
ghi.  But I have yet a wag left to my tongue--a word or two well spoken
that serves the occasion.  And still am I without my tobacco!  Who is
the one-eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my
pipe?'

It was hastily thrust in by a hillman, and a trickle of thick smoke
from each corner of the curtains showed that peace was restored.

If Kim had walked proudly the day before, disciple of a holy man, today
he paced with tenfold pride in the train of a semi-royal procession,
with a recognized place under the patronage of an old lady of charming
manners and infinite resource.  The escort, their heads tied up
native-fashion, fell in on either side the cart, shuffling enormous
clouds of dust.

The lama and Kim walked a little to one side; Kim chewing his stick of
sugarcane, and making way for no one under the status of a priest.
They could hear the old lady's tongue clack as steadily as a
rice-husker.  She bade the escort tell her what was going on on the
road; and so soon as they were clear of the parao she flung back the
curtains and peered out, her veil a third across her face. Her men did
not eye her directly when she addressed them, and thus the proprieties
were more or less observed.

A dark, sallowish District Superintendent of Police, faultlessly
uniformed, an Englishman, trotted by on a tired horse, and, seeing from
her retinue what manner of person she was, chaffed her.

'O mother,' he cried, 'do they do this in the zenanas?  Suppose an
Englishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose?'

'What?'  she shrilled back.  'Thine own mother has no nose?  Why say
so, then, on the open road?'

It was a fair counter.  The Englishman threw up his hand with the
gesture of a man hit at sword-play.  She laughed and nodded.

'Is this a face to tempt virtue aside?'  She withdrew all her veil and
stared at him.

It was by no means lovely, but as the man gathered up his reins he
called it a Moon of Paradise, a Disturber of Integrity, and a few other
fantastic epithets which doubled her up with mirth.

'That is a nut-cut [rogue],' she said.  'All police-constables are
nut-cuts; but the police-wallahs are the worst.  Hai, my son, thou hast
never learned all that since thou camest from Belait [Europe]. Who
suckled thee?'

'A pahareen--a hillwoman of Dalhousie, my mother.  Keep thy beauty
under a shade--O Dispenser of Delights,' and he was gone.

'These be the sort'--she took a fine judicial tone, and stuffed her
mouth with pan--'These be the sort to oversee justice.  They know the
land and the customs of the land.  The others, all new from Europe,
suckled by white women and learning our tongues from books, are worse
than the pestilence.  They do harm to Kings.'  Then she told a long,
long tale to the world at large, of an ignorant young policeman who had
disturbed some small Hill Rajah, a ninth cousin of her own, in the
matter of a trivial land-case, winding up with a quotation from a work
by no means devotional.

Then her mood changed, and she bade one of the escort ask whether the
lama would walk alongside and discuss matters of religion.  So Kim
dropped back into the dust and returned to his sugar-cane.  For an hour
or more the lama's tam-o'shanter showed like a moon through the haze;
and, from all he heard, Kim gathered that the old woman wept.  One of
the Ooryas half apologized for his rudeness overnight, saying that he
had never known his mistress of so bland a temper, and he ascribed it
to the presence of the strange priest. Personally, he believed in
Brahmins, though, like all natives, he was acutely aware of their
cunning and their greed.  Still, when Brahmins but irritated with
begging demands the mother of his master's wife, and when she sent them
away so angry that they cursed the whole retinue (which was the real
reason of the second off-side bullock going lame, and of the pole
breaking the night before), he was prepared to accept any priest of any
other denomination in or out of India.  To this Kim assented with wise
nods, and bade the Oorya observe that the lama took no money, and that
the cost of his and Kim's food would be repaid a hundred times in the
good luck that would attend the caravan henceforward.  He also told
stories of Lahore city, and sang a song or two which made the escort
laugh.  As a town-mouse well acquainted with the latest songs by the
most fashionable composers--they are women for the most part--Kim had a
distinct advantage over men from a little fruit-village behind
Saharunpore, but he let that advantage be inferred.

At noon they turned aside to eat, and the meal was good, plentiful, and
well-served on plates of clean leaves, in decency, out of drift of the
dust.  They gave the scraps to certain beggars, that all requirements
might be fulfilled, and sat down to a long, luxurious smoke.  The old
lady had retreated behind her curtains, but mixed most freely in the
talk, her servants arguing with and contradicting her as servants do
throughout the East.  She compared the cool and the pines of the Kangra
and Kulu hills with the dust and the mangoes of the South; she told a
tale of some old local Gods at the edge of her husband's territory; she
roundly abused the tobacco which she was then smoking, reviled all
Brahmins, and speculated without reserve on the coming of many
grandsons.




Chapter 5


  Here come I to my own again
  Fed, forgiven, and known again
  Claimed by bone of my bone again,
  And sib to flesh of my flesh!
  The fatted calf is dressed for me,
  But the husks have greater zest for me ...
  I think my pigs will be best for me,
  So I'm off to the styes afresh.

  The Prodigal Son.


Once more the lazy, string-tied, shuffling procession got under way,
and she slept till they reached the next halting-stage.  It was a very
short march, and time lacked an hour to sundown, so Kim cast about for
means of amusement.

'But why not sit and rest?'  said one of the escort.  'Only the devils
and the English walk to and fro without reason.'

'Never make friends with the Devil, a Monkey, or a Boy.  No man knows
what they will do next,' said his fellow.

Kim turned a scornful back--he did not want to hear the old story how
the Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly
across country.

The lama strode after him.  All that day, whenever they passed a
stream, he had turned aside to look at it, but in no case had he
received any warning that he had found his River.  Insensibly, too, the
comfort of speaking to someone in a reasonable tongue, and of being
properly considered and respected as her spiritual adviser by a
well-born woman, had weaned his thoughts a little from the Search.  And
further, he was prepared to spend serene years in his quest; having
nothing of the white man's impatience, but a great faith.

'Where goest thou?'  he called after Kim.

'Nowhither--it was a small march, and all this'--Kim waved his hands
abroad--'is new to me.'

'She is beyond question a wise and a discerning woman.  But it is hard
to meditate when--'

'All women are thus.'  Kim spoke as might have Solomon.

'Before the lamassery was a broad platform,' the lama muttered, looping
up the well-worn rosary, 'of stone.  On that I have left the marks of
my feet--pacing to and fro with these.'

He clicked the beads, and began the 'Om mane pudme hum's of his
devotion; grateful for the cool, the quiet, and the absence of dust.

One thing after another drew Kim's idle eye across the plain.  There
was no purpose in his wanderings, except that the build of the huts
near by seemed new, and he wished to investigate.

They came out on a broad tract of grazing-ground, brown and purple in
the afternoon light, with a heavy clump of mangoes in the centre.  It
struck Kim as curious that no shrine stood in so eligible a spot:  the
boy was observing as any priest for these things.  Far across the plain
walked side by side four men, made small by the distance.  He looked
intently under his curved palms and caught the sheen of brass.

'Soldiers.  White soldiers!'  said he.  'Let us see.'

'It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together.  But I
have never seen the white soldiers.'

'They do no harm except when they are drunk.  Keep behind this tree.'

They stepped behind the thick trunks in the cool dark of the
mango-tope. Two little figures halted; the other two came forward
uncertainly.  They were the advance-party of a regiment on the march,
sent out, as usual, to mark the camp.  They bore five-foot sticks with
fluttering flags, and called to each other as they spread over the flat
earth.

At last they entered the mango-grove, walking heavily.

'It's here or hereabouts--officers' tents under the trees, I take it,
an' the rest of us can stay outside.  Have they marked out for the
baggage-wagons behind?'

They cried again to their comrades in the distance, and the rough
answer came back faint and mellowed.

'Shove the flag in here, then,' said one.

'What do they prepare?'  said the lama, wonderstruck.  'This is a great
and terrible world.  What is the device on the flag?'

A soldier thrust a stave within a few feet of them, grunted
discontentedly, pulled it up again, conferred with his companion, who
looked up and down the shaded cave of greenery, and returned it.

Kim stared with all his eyes, his breath coming short and sharp between
his teeth.  The soldiers stamped off into the sunshine.

'O Holy One!'  he gasped.  'My horoscope!  The drawing in the dust by
the priest at Umballa!  Remember what he said.  First come
two--ferashes--to make all things ready--in a dark place, as it is
always at the beginning of a vision.'

'But this is not vision,' said the lama.  'It is the world's Illusion,
and no more.'

'And after them comes the Bull--the Red Bull on the green field. Look!
It is he!'

He pointed to the flag that was snap snapping in the evening breeze not
ten feet away.  It was no more than an ordinary camp marking-flag; but
the regiment, always punctilious in matters of millinery, had charged
it with the regimental device, the Red Bull, which is the crest of the
Mavericks--the great Red Bull on a background of Irish green.

'I see, and now I remember.'  said the lama.  'Certainly it is thy
Bull.  Certainly, also, the two men came to make all ready.'

'They are soldiers--white soldiers.  What said the priest?  "The sign
over against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men."  Holy One,
this thing touches my Search.'

'True.  It is true.'  The lama stared fixedly at the device that flamed
like a ruby in the dusk.  'The priest at Umballa said that thine was
the sign of War.'

'What is to do now?'

'Wait.  Let us wait.'

'Even now the darkness clears,' said Kim.  It was only natural that the
descending sun should at last strike through the tree-trunks, across
the grove, filling it with mealy gold light for a few minutes; but to
Kim it was the crown of the Umballa Brahmin's prophecy.

'Hark!'  said the lama.  'One beats a drum--far off!'

At first the sound, carrying diluted through the still air, resembled
the beating of an artery in the head.  Soon a sharpness was added.

'Ah!  The music,' Kim explained.  He knew the sound of a regimental
band, but it amazed the lama.

At the far end of the plain a heavy, dusty column crawled in sight.
Then the wind brought the tune:

  We crave your condescension
  To tell you what we know
  Of marching in the Mulligan Guards
  To Sligo Port below!

Here broke in the shrill-tongued fifes:

  We shouldered arms,
  We marched--we marched away.
  From Phoenix Park
  We marched to Dublin Bay.
  The drums and the fifes,
  Oh, sweetly they did play,
  As we marched--marched--marched--with the
  Mulligan Guards!

It was the band of the Mavericks playing the regiment to camp; for the
men were route-marching with their baggage.  The rippling column swung
into the level--carts behind it divided left and right, ran about like
an ant-hill, and ...

'But this is sorcery!'  said the lama.

The plain dotted itself with tents that seemed to rise, all spread,
from the carts.  Another rush of men invaded the grove, pitched a huge
tent in silence, ran up yet eight or nine more by the side of it,
unearthed cooking-pots, pans, and bundles, which were taken possession
of by a crowd of native servants; and behold the mango-tope turned into
an orderly town as they watched!

'Let us go,' said the lama, sinking back afraid, as the fires twinkled
and white officers with jingling swords stalked into the Mess-tent.

'Stand back in the shadow.  No one can see beyond the light of a fire,'
said Kim, his eyes still on the flag.  He had never before watched the
routine of a seasoned regiment pitching camp in thirty minutes.

'Look!  look!  look!'  clucked the lama.  'Yonder comes a priest.'  It
was Bennett, the Church of England Chaplain of the regiment, limping in
dusty black.  One of his flock had made some rude remarks about the
Chaplain's mettle; and to abash him Bennett had marched step by step
with the men that day.  The black dress, gold cross on the watch-chain,
the hairless face, and the soft, black wideawake hat would have marked
him as a holy man anywhere in all India.  He dropped into a camp-chair
by the door of the Mess-tent and slid off his boots.  Three or four
officers gathered round him, laughing and joking over his exploit.

'The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said the lama,
who judged only by tone.  'But I considered the countenance of that
priest and I think he is learned.  Is it likely that he will understand
our talk?  I would talk to him of my Search.'

'Never speak to a white man till he is fed,' said Kim, quoting a
well-known proverb.  'They will eat now, and--and I do not think they
are good to beg from.  Let us go back to the resting-place. After we
have eaten we will come again.  It certainly was a Red Bull--my Red
Bull.'

They were both noticeably absent-minded when the old lady's retinue set
their meal before them; so none broke their reserve, for it is not
lucky to annoy guests.

'Now,' said Kim, picking his teeth, 'we will return to that place; but
thou, O Holy One, must wait a little way off, because thy feet are
heavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull.'

'But how canst thou understand the talk?  Walk slowly.  The road is
dark,' the lama replied uneasily.

Kim put the question aside.  'I marked a place near to the trees,' said
he, 'where thou canst sit till I call.  Nay,' as the lama made some
sort of protest, 'remember this is my Search--the Search for my Red
Bull.  The sign in the Stars was not for thee.  I know a little of the
customs of white soldiers, and I always desire to see some new things.'

'What dost thou not know of this world?'  The lama squatted obediently
in a little hollow of the ground not a hundred yards from the hump of
the mango-trees dark against the star-powdered sky.

'Stay till I call.'  Kim flitted into the dusk.  He knew that in all
probability there would be sentries round the camp, and smiled to
himself as he heard the thick boots of one.  A boy who can dodge over
the roofs of Lahore city on a moonlight night, using every little patch
and corner of darkness to discomfit his pursuer, is not likely to be
checked by a line of well-trained soldiers.  He paid them the
compliment of crawling between a couple, and, running and halting,
crouching and dropping flat, worked his way toward the lighted
Mess-tent where, close pressed behind the mango-tree, he waited till
some chance word should give him a returnable lead.

The one thing now in his mind was further information as to the Red
Bull.  For aught he knew, and Kim's limitations were as curious and
sudden as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of
his father's prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus
pray to the Holy Cow.  That at least would be entirely right and
logical, and the padre with the gold cross would be therefore the man
to consult in the matter.  On the other hand, remembering sober-faced
padres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the priest might be an
inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn.  But had it not been
proven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and
armed men?  Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the
World, crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets?  Lastly--and firstly
as the undercurrent of all his quick thoughts--this adventure, though
he did not know the English word, was a stupendous lark--a delightful
continuation of his old flights across the housetops, as well as the
fulfilment of sublime prophecy.  He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards
the Mess-tent door, a hand on the amulet round his neck.

It was as he suspected.  The Sahibs prayed to their God; for in the
centre of the Mess-table--its sole ornament when they were on the line
of march--stood a golden bull fashioned from old-time loot of the
Summer Palace at Pekin--a red-gold bull with lowered head, ramping upon
a field of Irish green.  To him the Sahibs held out their glasses and
cried aloud confusedly.

Now the Reverend Arthur Bennett always left Mess after that toast, and
being rather tired by his march his movements were more abrupt than
usual.  Kim, with slightly raised head, was still staring at his totem
on the table, when the Chaplain stepped on his right shoulder-blade.
Kim flinched under the leather, and, rolling sideways, brought down the
Chaplain, who, ever a man of action, caught him by the throat and
nearly choked the life out of him.  Kim then kicked him desperately in
the stomach.  Mr Bennett gasped and doubled up, but without relaxing
his grip, rolled over again, and silently hauled Kim to his own tent.
The Mavericks were incurable practical jokers; and it occurred to the
Englishman that silence was best till he had made complete inquiry.

'Why, it's a boy!'  he said, as he drew his prize under the light of
the tent-pole lantern, then shaking him severely cried:  'What were you
doing?  You're a thief.  Choor?  Mallum?'  His Hindustani was very
limited, and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the
character laid down for him.  As he recovered his breath he was
inventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some
scullion, and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under
the Chaplain's left arm-pit.  The chance came; he ducked for the
doorway, but a long arm shot out and clutched at his neck, snapping the
amulet-string and closing on the amulet.

'Give it me.  O, give it me.  Is it lost?  Give me the papers.'

The words were in English--the tinny, saw-cut English of the
native-bred, and the Chaplain jumped.

'A scapular,' said he, opening his hand.  'No, some sort of heathen
charm.  Why--why, do you speak English?  Little boys who steal are
beaten.  You know that?'

'I do not--I did not steal.'  Kim danced in agony like a terrier at a
lifted stick.  'Oh, give it me.  It is my charm.  Do not thieve it from
me.'

The Chaplain took no heed, but, going to the tent door, called aloud.
A fattish, clean-shaven man appeared.

'I want your advice, Father Victor,' said Bennett.  'I found this boy
in the dark outside the Mess-tent.  Ordinarily, I should have chastised
him and let him go, because I believe him to be a thief. But it seems
he talks English, and he attaches some sort of value to a charm round
his neck.  I thought perhaps you might help me.'

Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent
lay, as Bennett believed, an unbridgeable gulf, but it was noticeable
that whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was
very likely to call in the Church of Rome. Bennett's official
abhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by
his private respect for Father Victor.

'A thief talking English, is it?  Let's look at his charm.  No, it's
not a scapular, Bennett.'  He held out his hand.

'But have we any right to open it?  A sound whipping--'

'I did not thieve,' protested Kim.  'You have hit me kicks all over my
body.  Now give me my charm and I will go away.'

'Not quite so fast.  We'll look first,' said Father Victor, leisurely
rolling out poor Kimball O'Hara's 'ne varietur' parchment, his
clearance-certificate, and Kim's baptismal certificate.  On this last
O'Hara--with some confused idea that he was doing wonders for his
son--had scrawled scores of times:  'Look after the boy.  Please look
after the boy'--signing his name and regimental number in full.

'Powers of Darkness below!'  said Father Victor, passing all over to Mr
Bennett.  'Do you know what these things are?'

'Yes.'  said Kim.  'They are mine, and I want to go away.'

'I do not quite understand,' said Mr Bennett.  'He probably brought
them on purpose.  It may be a begging trick of some kind.'

'I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company, then.
There's the makings of a gay mystery here.  Ye believe in Providence,
Bennett?'

'I hope so.'

'Well, I believe in miracles, so it comes to the same thing.  Powers of
Darkness!  Kimball O'Hara!  And his son!  But then he's a native, and I
saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott.  How long have you had these
things, boy?'

'Ever since I was a little baby.'

Father Victor stepped forward quickly and opened the front of Kim's
upper garment.  'You see, Bennett, he's not very black.  What's your
name?'

'Kim.'

'Or Kimball?'

'Perhaps.  Will you let me go away?'

'What else?'

'They call me Kim Rishti ke.  That is Kim of the Rishti.'

'What is that--"Rishti"?'

'Eye-rishti--that was the Regiment--my father's.'

'Irish--oh, I see.'

'Yess.  That was how my father told me.  My father, he has lived.'

'Has lived where?'

'Has lived.  Of course he is dead--gone-out.'

'Oh!  That's your abrupt way of putting it, is it?'

Bennett interrupted.  'It is possible I have done the boy an injustice.
He is certainly white, though evidently neglected.  I am sure I must
have bruised him.  I do not think spirits--'

'Get him a glass of sherry, then, and let him squat on the cot. Now,
Kim,' continued Father Victor, 'no one is going to hurt you. Drink that
down and tell us about yourself.  The truth, if you've no objection.'

Kim coughed a little as he put down the empty glass, and considered.
This seemed a time for caution and fancy.  Small boys who prowl about
camps are generally turned out after a whipping. But he had received no
stripes; the amulet was evidently working in his favour, and it looked
as though the Umballa horoscope and the few words that he could
remember of his father's maunderings fitted in most miraculously.  Else
why did the fat padre seem so impressed, and why the glass of hot
yellow drink from the lean one?

'My father, he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little.  The
woman, she kept kabarri shop near where the hire-carriages are.' Kim
began with a plunge, not quite sure how far the truth would serve him.

'Your mother?'

'No!'--with a gesture of disgust.  'She went out when I was born. My
father, he got these papers from the Jadoo-Gher what do you call that?'
(Bennett nodded) 'because he was in good-standing.  What do you call
that?'  (again Bennett nodded).  'My father told me that.  He said,
too, and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa
two days ago, he said, that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field
and that the Bull shall help me.'

'A phenomenal little liar,' muttered Bennett.

'Powers of Darkness below, what a country!'  murmured Father Victor.
'Go on, Kim.'

'I did not thieve.  Besides, I am just now disciple of a very holy man.
He is sitting outside.  We saw two men come with flags, making the
place ready.  That is always so in a dream, or on account of
a--a--prophecy.  So I knew it was come true.  I saw the Red Bull on the
green field, and my father he said:  "Nine hundred pukka devils and the
Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red
Bull!"  I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull, but I went away
and I came again when it was dark.  I wanted to see the Bull again, and
I saw the Bull again with the--the Sahibs praying to it.  I think the
Bull shall help me.  The holy man said so too.  He is sitting outside.
Will you hurt him, if I call him a shout now? He is very holy.  He can
witness to all the things I say, and he knows I am not a thief.'

'"Sahibs praying to a bull!"  What in the world do you make of that?'
said Bennett.  "'Disciple of a holy man!"  Is the boy mad?'

'It's O'Hara's boy, sure enough.  O'Hara's boy leagued with all the
Powers of Darkness.  It's very much what his father would have done if
he was drunk.  We'd better invite the holy man.  He may know something.'

'He does not know anything,' said Kim.  'I will show you him if you
come.  He is my master.  Then afterwards we can go.'

'Powers of Darkness!'  was all that Father Victor could say, as Bennett
marched off, with a firm hand on Kim's shoulder.

They found the lama where he had dropped.

'The Search is at an end for me,' shouted Kim in the vernacular.  'I
have found the Bull, but God knows what comes next.  They will not hurt
you.  Come to the fat priest's tent with this thin man and see the end.
It is all new, and they cannot talk Hindi.  They are only uncurried
donkeys.'

'Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance,' the lama
returned.  'I am glad if thou art rejoiced, chela.'

Dignified and unsuspicious, he strode into the little tent, saluted the
Churches as a Churchman, and sat down by the open charcoal brazier.
The yellow lining of the tent reflected in the lamplight made his face
red-gold.

Bennett looked at him with the triple-ringed uninterest of the creed
that lumps nine-tenths of the world under the title of 'heathen'.

'And what was the end of the Search?  What gift has the Red Bull
brought?'  The lama addressed himself to Kim.

'He says, "What are you going to do?"'  Bennett was staring uneasily at
Father Victor, and Kim, for his own ends, took upon himself the office
of interpreter.

'I do not see what concern this fakir has with the boy, who is probably
his dupe or his confederate,' Bennett began.  'We cannot allow an
English boy--Assuming that he is the son of a Mason, the sooner he goes
to the Masonic Orphanage the better.'

'Ah!  That's your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge,' said
Father Victor; 'but we might as well tell the old man what we are going
to do.  He doesn't look like a villain.'

'My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind.  Now,
Kimball, I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word.'

Kim gathered the import of the next few sentences and began thus:

'Holy One, the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son
of a Sahib.'

'But how?'

'Oh, it is true.  I knew it since my birth, but he could only find it
out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers.  He
thinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib, and between the two of them
they purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a madrissah
[a school].  It has happened before.  I have always avoided it.  The
fat fool is of one mind and the camel-like one of another.  But that is
no odds.  I may spend one night here and perhaps the next.  It has
happened before.  Then I will run away and return to thee.'

'But tell them that thou art my chela.  Tell them how thou didst come
to me when I was faint and bewildered.  Tell them of our Search, and
they will surely let thee go now.'

'I have already told them.  They laugh, and they talk of the police.'

'What are you saying?'  asked Mr Bennett.

'Oah.  He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in
his business--his ur-gent private af-fairs.'  This last was a
reminiscence of some talk with a Eurasian clerk in the Canal
Department, but it only drew a smile, which nettled him.  'And if you
did know what his business was you would not be in such a beastly hurry
to interfere.'

'What is it then?'  said Father Victor, not without feeling, as he
watched the lama's face.

'There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree
much.  It was put out by an Arrow which--' Kim tapped his foot
impatiently as he translated in his own mind from the vernacular to his
clumsy English.  'Oah, it was made by our Lord God Buddha, you know,
and if you wash there you are washed away from all your sins and made
as white as cotton-wool.'  (Kim had heard mission-talk in his time.) 'I
am his disciple, and we must find that River.  It is so verree valuable
to us.'

'Say that again,' said Bennett.  Kim obeyed, with amplifications.

'But this is gross blasphemy!'  cried the Church of England.

'Tck!  Tck!'  said Father Victor sympathetically.  'I'd give a good
deal to be able to talk the vernacular.  A river that washes away sin!
And how long have you two been looking for it?'

'Oh, many days.  Now we wish to go away and look for it again.  It is
not here, you see.'

'I see,' said Father Victor gravely.  'But he can't go on in that old
man's company.  It would be different, Kim, if you were not a soldier's
son.  Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as
good a man as your--as good a man as can be.  Tell him that if he
believes in miracles he must believe that--'

'There is no need to play on his credulity,' Bennett interrupted.

'I'm doing no such thing.  He must believe that the boy's coming
here--to his own Regiment--in search of his Red Bull is in the nature
of a miracle.  Consider the chances against it, Bennett.  This one boy
in all India, and our Regiment of all others on the line o' march for
him to meet with!  It's predestined on the face of it. Yes, tell him
it's Kismet.  Kismet, mallum?  [Do you understand?]'

He turned towards the lama, to whom he might as well have talked of
Mesopotamia.

'They say,'--the old man's eye lighted at Kim's speech 'they say that
the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished, and that being led
back--though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity--to these people
and their Red Bull I must needs go to a madrissah and be turned into a
Sahib.  Now I make pretence of agreement, for at the worst it will be
but a few meals eaten away from thee.  Then I will slip away and follow
down the road to Saharunpore. Therefore, Holy One, keep with that Kulu
woman--on no account stray far from her cart till I come again.  Past
question, my sign is of War and of armed men.  See how they have given
me wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour!  My father must have
been some great person.  So if they raise me to honour among them,
good. If not, good again.  However it goes, I will run back to thee
when I am tired.  But stay with the Rajputni, or I shall miss thy feet
... Oah yess,' said the boy, 'I have told him everything you tell me to
say.'

'And I cannot see any need why he should wait,' said Bennett, feeling
in his trouser-pocket.  'We can investigate the details later--and I
will give him a ru--'

'Give him time.  Maybe he's fond of the lad,' said Father Victor, half
arresting the clergyman's motion.

The lama dragged forth his rosary and pulled his huge hat-brim over his
eyes.

'What can he want now?'

'He says'--Kim put up one hand.  'He says:  "Be quiet."  He wants to
speak to me by himself.  You see, you do not know one little word of
what he says, and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad
curses.  When he takes those beads like that, you see, he always wants
to be quiet.'

The two Englishmen sat overwhelmed, but there was a look in Bennett's
eye that promised ill for Kim when he should be relaxed to the
religious arm.

'A Sahib and the son of a Sahib--' The lama's voice was harsh with
pain.  'But no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as
thou knowest.  How comes it this is true?'

'What matter, Holy One?--but remember it is only for a night or two.
Remember, I can change swiftly.  It will all be as it was when I first
spoke to thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun--'

'As a boy in the dress of white men--when I first went to the Wonder
House.  And a second time thou wast a Hindu.  What shall the third
incarnation be?'  He chuckled drearily.  'Ah, chela, thou has done a
wrong to an old man because my heart went out to thee.'

'And mine to thee.  But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring
me to this business?'

The lama covered his face afresh, and nervously rattled the rosary. Kim
squatted beside him and laid hold upon a fold of his clothing.

'Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib?'  he went on in a
muffled tone.  'Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the
Wonder House.'  The lama's experience of white men was limited.  He
seemed to be repeating a lesson.  'So then it is not seemly that he
should do other than as the Sahibs do.  He must go back to his own
people.'

'For a day and a night and a day,' Kim pleaded.

'No, ye don't!'  Father Victor saw Kim edging towards the door, and
interposed a strong leg.

'I do not understand the customs of white men.  The Priest of the
Images in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin
one here.  This boy will be taken from me.  They will make a Sahib of
my disciple?  Woe to me!  How shall I find my River?  Have they no
disciples?  Ask.'

'He says he is very sorree that he cannot find the River now any more.
He says, Why have you no disciples, and stop bothering him? He wants to
be washed of his sins.'

Neither Bennett nor Father Victor found any answer ready.

Said Kim in English, distressed for the lama's agony:  'I think if you
will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal.  We will
look for that River like before I was caught.  I wish I did not come
here to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing.  I do not want
it.'

'It's the very best day's work you ever did for yourself, young man,'
said Bennett.

'Good heavens, I don't know how to console him,' said Father Victor,
watching the lama intently.  'He can't take the boy away with him, and
yet he's a good man--I'm sure he's a good man. Bennett, if you give him
that rupee he'll curse you root and branch!'

They listened to each other's breathing--three--five full minutes.
Then the lama raised his head, and looked forth across them into space
and emptiness.

'And I am a Follower of the Way,' he said bitterly.  'The sin is mine
and the punishment is mine.  I made believe to myself for now I see it
was but make-belief--that thou wast sent to me to aid in the Search.
So my heart went out to thee for thy charity and thy courtesy and the
wisdom of thy little years.  But those who follow the Way must permit
not the fire of any desire or attachment, for that is all Illusion.  As
says ...'  He quoted an old, old Chinese text, backed it with another,
and reinforced these with a third.  'I stepped aside from the Way, my
chela.  It was no fault of thine.  I delighted in the sight of life,
the new people upon the roads, and in thy joy at seeing these things.
I was pleased with thee who should have considered my Search and my
Search alone.  Now I am sorrowful because thou art taken away and my
River is far from me. It is the Law which I have broken!'

'Powers of Darkness below!'  said Father Victor, who, wise in the
confessional, heard the pain in every sentence.

'I see now that the sign of the Red Bull was a sign for me as well as
for thee.  All Desire is red--and evil.  I will do penance and find my
River alone.'

'At least go back to the Kulu woman,' said Kim, 'otherwise thou wilt be
lost upon the roads.  She will feed thee till I run back to thee.'

The lama waved a hand to show that the matter was finally settled in
his mind.

'Now,'--his tone altered as he turned to Kim,--'what will they do with
thee?  At least I may, acquiring merit, wipe out past ill.'

'Make me a Sahib--so they think.  The day after tomorrow I return. Do
not grieve.'

'Of what sort?  Such an one as this or that man?'  He pointed to Father
Victor.  'Such an one as those I saw this evening, men wearing swords
and stamping heavily?'

'Maybe.'

'That is not well.  These men follow desire and come to emptiness. Thou
must not be of their sort.'

'The Umballa priest said that my Star was War,' Kim interjected.  'I
will ask these fools--but there is truly no need.  I will run away this
night, for all I wanted to see the new things.'

Kim put two or three questions in English to Father Victor, translating
the replies to the lama.

Then:  'He says, "You take him from me and you cannot say what you will
make him."  He says, "Tell me before I go, for it is not a small thing
to make a child."'

'You will be sent to a school.  Later on, we shall see.  Kimball, I
suppose you'd like to be a soldier?'

'Gorah-log [white-folk].  No-ah!  No-ah!'  Kim shook his head
violently.  There was nothing in his composition to which drill and
routine appealed.  'I will not be a soldier.'

'You will be what you're told to be,' said Bennett; 'and you should be
grateful that we're going to help you.'

Kim smiled compassionately.  If these men lay under the delusion that
he would do anything that he did not fancy, so much the better.

Another long silence followed.  Bennett fidgeted with impatience, and
suggested calling a sentry to evict the fakir.

'Do they give or sell learning among the Sahibs?  Ask them,' said the
lama, and Kim interpreted.

'They say that money is paid to the teacher--but that money the
Regiment will give ...  What need?  It is only for a night.'

'And--the more money is paid the better learning is given?'  The lama
disregarded Kim's plans for an early flight.  'It is no wrong to pay
for learning.  To help the ignorant to wisdom is always a merit.'  The
rosary clicked furiously as an abacus.  Then he faced his oppressors.

'Ask them for how much money do they give a wise and suitable teaching?
And in what city is that teaching given?'

'Well,' said Father Victor in English, when Kim had translated, 'that
depends.  The Regiment would pay for you all the time you are at the
Military Orphanage; or you might go on the Punjab Masonic Orphanage's
list (not that he or you 'ud understand what that means); but the best
schooling a boy can get in India is, of course, at St Xavier's in
Partibus at Lucknow.'  This took some time to interpret, for Bennett
wished to cut it short.

'He wants to know how much?'  said Kim placidly.

'Two or three hundred rupees a year.'  Father Victor was long past any
sense of amazement.  Bennett, impatient, did not understand.

'He says:  "Write that name and the money upon a paper and give it
him."  And he says you must write your name below, because he is going
to write a letter in some days to you.  He says you are a good man.  He
says the other man is a fool.  He is going away.'

The lama rose suddenly.  'I follow my Search,' he cried, and was gone.

'He'll run slap into the sentries,' cried Father Victor, jumping up as
the lama stalked out; 'but I can't leave the boy.'  Kim made swift
motion to follow, but checked himself.  There was no sound of challenge
outside.  The lama had disappeared.

Kim settled himself composedly on the Chaplain's cot.  At least the
lama had promised that he would stay with the Raiput woman from Kulu,
and the rest was of the smallest importance.  It pleased him that the
two padres were so evidently excited.  They talked long in undertones,
Father Victor urging some scheme on Mr Bennett, who seemed incredulous.
All this was very new and fascinating, but Kim felt sleepy.  They
called men into the tent--one of them certainly was the Colonel, as his
father had prophesied--and they asked him an infinity of questions,
chiefly about the woman who looked after him, all of which Kim answered
truthfully.  They did not seem to think the woman a good guardian.

After all, this was the newest of his experiences.  Sooner or later, if
he chose, he could escape into great, grey, formless India, beyond
tents and padres and colonels.  Meantime, if the Sahibs were to be
impressed, he would do his best to impress them.  He too was a white
man.

After much talk that he could not comprehend, they handed him over to a
sergeant, who had strict instructions not to let him escape. The
Regiment would go on to Umballa, and Kim would be sent up, partly at
the expense of the Lodge and in part by subscription, to a place called
Sanawar.

'It's miraculous past all whooping, Colonel,' said Father Victor, when
he had talked without a break for ten minutes.  'His Buddhist friend
has levanted after taking my name and address.  I can't quite make out
whether he'll pay for the boy's education or whether he is preparing
some sort of witchcraft on his own account.'  Then to Kim: 'You'll live
to be grateful to your friend the Red Bull yet.  We'll make a man of
you at Sanawar--even at the price o' making you a Protestant.'

'Certainly--most certainly,' said Bennett.

'But you will not go to Sanawar,' said Kim.

'But we will go to Sanawar, little man.  That's the order of the
Commander-in-Chief, who's a trifle more important than O'Hara's son.'

'You will not go to Sanawar.  You will go to thee War.'

There was a shout of laughter from the full tent.

'When you know your own Regiment a trifle better you won't confuse the
line of march with line of battle, Kim.  We hope to go to "thee War"
sometime.'

'Oah, I know all thatt.'  Kim drew his bow again at a venture.  If they
were not going to the war, at least they did not know what he knew of
the talk in the veranda at Umballa.

'I know you are not at thee war now; but I tell you that as soon as you
get to Umballa you will be sent to the war--the new war.  It is a war
of eight thousand men, besides the guns.'

'That's explicit.  D'you add prophecy to your other gifts?  Take him
along, sergeant.  Take up a suit for him from the Drums, an' take care
he doesn't slip through your fingers.  Who says the age of miracles is
gone by?  I think I'll go to bed.  My poor mind's weakening.'

At the far end of the camp, silent as a wild animal, an hour later sat
Kim, newly washed all over, in a horrible stiff suit that rasped his
arms and legs.

'A most amazin' young bird,' said the sergeant.  'He turns up in charge
of a yellow-headed buck-Brahmin priest, with his father's Lodge
certificates round his neck, talkin' God knows what all of a red bull.
The buck-Brahmin evaporates without explanations, an' the bhoy sets
cross-legged on the Chaplain's bed prophesyin' bloody war to the men at
large.  Injia's a wild land for a God-fearin' man. I'll just tie his
leg to the tent-pole in case he'll go through the roof.  What did ye
say about the war?'

'Eight thousand men, besides guns,' said Kim.  'Very soon you will see.'

'You're a consolin' little imp.  Lie down between the Drums an' go to
bye-bye.  Those two boys will watch your slumbers.'




Chapter 6


  Now I remember comrades--
  Old playmates on new seas--
  Whenas we traded orpiment
  Among the savages.
  Ten thousand leagues to southward,
  And thirty years removed--
  They knew not noble Valdez,
  But me they knew and loved.

  Song of Diego Valdez.


Very early in the morning the white tents came down and disappeared as
the Mavericks took a side-road to Umballa.  It did not skirt the
resting-place, and Kim, trudging beside a baggage-cart under fire of
comments from soldiers' wives, was not so confident as overnight.  He
discovered that he was closely watched--Father Victor on the one side,
and Mr Bennett on the other.

In the forenoon the column checked.  A camel-orderly handed the Colonel
a letter.  He read it, and spoke to a Major.  Half a mile in the rear,
Kim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the
thick dust.  Then someone beat him on the back, crying: 'Tell us how ye
knew, ye little limb of Satan?  Father dear, see if ye can make him
tell.'

A pony ranged alongside, and he was hauled on to the priest's saddlebow.

'Now, my son, your prophecy of last night has come true.  Our orders
are to entrain at Umballa for the Front tomorrow.'

'What is thatt?'  said Kim, for 'front' and 'entrain' were newish words
to him.

'We are going to "thee War," as you called it.'

'Of course you are going to thee War.  I said last night.'

'Ye did; but, Powers o' Darkness, how did ye know?'

Kim's eyes sparkled.  He shut his lips, nodded his head, and looked
unspeakable things.  The Chaplain moved on through the dust, and
privates, sergeants, and subalterns called one another's attention to
the boy.  The Colonel, at the head of the column, stared at him
curiously.  'It was probably some bazar rumour.'  he said; 'but even
then--' He referred to the paper in his hand.  'Hang it all, the thing
was only decided within the last forty-eight hours.'

'Are there many more like you in India?'  said Father Victor, 'or are
you by way o' being a lusus naturae?'

'Now I have told you,' said the boy, 'will you let me go back to my old
man?  If he has not stayed with that woman from Kulu, I am afraid he
will die.'

'By what I saw of him he's as well able to take care of himself as you.
No.  Ye've brought us luck, an' we're goin' to make a man of you.  I'll
take ye back to your baggage-cart and ye'll come to me this evening.'

For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished
consideration among a few hundred white men.  The story of his
appearance in camp, the discovery of his parentage, and his prophecy,
had lost nothing in the telling.  A big, shapeless white woman on a
pile of bedding asked him mysteriously whether he thought her husband
would come back from the war.  Kim reflected gravely, and said that he
would, and the woman gave him food.  In many respects, this big
procession that played music at intervals--this crowd that talked and
laughed so easily--resembled a festival in Lahore city.  So far, there
was no sign of hard work, and he resolved to lend the spectacle his
patronage.  At evening there came out to meet them bands of music, and
played the Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway station.  That was
an interesting night.  Men of other regiments came to visit the
Mavericks.  The Mavericks went visiting on their own account.  Their
pickets hurried forth to bring them back, met pickets of strange
regiments on the same duty; and, after a while, the bugles blew madly
for more pickets with officers to control the tumult.  The Mavericks
had a reputation for liveliness to live up to.  But they fell in on the
platform next morning in perfect shape and condition; and Kim, left
behind with the sick, women, and boys, found himself shouting farewells
excitedly as the trains drew away.  Life as a Sahib was amusing so far;
but he touched it with a cautious hand.  Then they marched him back in
charge of a drummer-boy to empty, lime-washed barracks, whose floors
were covered with rubbish and string and paper, and whose ceilings gave
back his lonely footfall.  Native-fashion, he curled himself up on a
stripped cot and went to sleep.  An angry man stumped down the veranda,
woke him up, and said he was a schoolmaster.  This was enough for Kim,
and he retired into his shell.  He could just puzzle out the various
English Police notices in Lahore city, because they affected his
comfort; and among the many guests of the woman who looked after him
had been a queer German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling
theatre.  He told Kim that he had been 'on the barricades in
'Forty-eight,' and therefore--at least that was how it struck Kim--he
would teach the boy to write in return for food.  Kim had been kicked
as far as single letters, but did not think well of them.

'I do not know anything.  Go away!'  said Kim, scenting evil. Hereupon
the man caught him by the ear, dragged him to a room in a far-off wing
where a dozen drummer-boys were sitting on forms, and told him to be
still if he could do nothing else.  This he managed very successfully.
The man explained something or other with white lines on a black board
for at least half an hour, and Kim continued his interrupted nap.  He
much disapproved of the present aspect of affairs, for this was the
very school and discipline he had spent two-thirds of his young life in
avoiding.  Suddenly a beautiful idea occurred to him, and he wondered
that he had not thought of it before.

The man dismissed them, and first to spring through the veranda into
the open sunshine was Kim.

''Ere, you!  'Alt!  Stop!'  said a high voice at his heels.  'I've got
to look after you.  My orders are not to let you out of my sight. Where
are you goin'?'

It was the drummer-boy who had been hanging round him all the
forenoon--a fat and freckled person of about fourteen, and Kim loathed
him from the soles of his boots to his cap-ribbons.

'To the bazar--to get sweets--for you,' said Kim, after thought.

'Well, the bazar's out o' bounds.  If we go there we'll get a
dressing-down.  You come back.'

'How near can we go?'  Kim did not know what bounds meant, but he
wished to be polite--for the present.

''Ow near?  'Ow far, you mean!  We can go as far as that tree down the
road.'

'Then I will go there.'

'All right.  I ain't goin'.  It's too 'ot.  I can watch you from 'ere.
It's no good your runnin' away.  If you did, they'd spot you by your
clothes.  That's regimental stuff you're wearin'.  There ain't a picket
in Umballa wouldn't 'ead you back quicker than you started out.'

This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment
would tire him out if he tried to run.  He slouched to the tree at the
corner of a bare road leading towards the bazar, and eyed the natives
passing.  Most of them were barrack-servants of the lowest caste.  Kim
hailed a sweeper, who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary
insolence, in the natural belief that the European boy could not follow
it.  The low, quick answer undeceived him.  Kim put his fettered soul
into it, thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in the tongue
he knew best.  'And now, go to the nearest letter-writer in the bazar
and tell him to come here.  I would write a letter.'

'But--but what manner of white man's son art thou to need a bazar
letter-writer?  Is there not a schoolmaster in the barracks?'

'Ay; and Hell is full of the same sort.  Do my order, you--you Od! Thy
mother was married under a basket!  Servant of Lal Beg' (Kim knew the
God of the sweepers), 'run on my business or we will talk again.'

The sweeper shuffled off in haste.  'There is a white boy by the
barracks waiting under a tree who is not a white boy,' he stammered to
the first bazar letter-writer he came across.  'He needs thee.'

'Will he pay?'  said the spruce scribe, gathering up his desk and pens
and sealing-wax all in order.

'I do not know.  He is not like other boys.  Go and see.  It is well
worth.'

Kim danced with impatience when the slim young Kayeth hove in sight.
As soon as his voice could carry he cursed him volubly.

'First I will take my pay,' the letter-writer said.  'Bad words have
made the price higher.  But who art thou, dressed in that fashion, to
speak in this fashion?'

'Aha!  That is in the letter which thou shalt write.  Never was such a
tale.  But I am in no haste.  Another writer will serve me.  Umballa
city is as full of them as is Lahore.'

'Four annas,' said the writer, sitting down and spreading his cloth in
the shade of a deserted barrack-wing.

Mechanically Kim squatted beside him--squatted as only the natives
can--in spite of the abominable clinging trousers.

The writer regarded him sideways.

'That is the price to ask of Sahibs,' said Kim.  'Now fix me a true
one.'

'An anna and a half.  How do I know, having written the letter, that
thou wilt not run away?'

I must not go beyond this tree, and there is also the stamp to be
considered.'

'I get no commission on the price of the stamp.  Once more, what manner
of white boy art thou?'

'That shall be said in the letter, which is to Mahbub Ali, the
horse-dealer in the Kashmir Serai, at Lahore.  He is my friend.'

'Wonder on wonder!'  murmured the letter-writer, dipping a reed in the
inkstand.  'To be written in Hindi?'

'Assuredly.  To Mahbub Ali then.  Begin!  I have come down with the old
man as far as Umballa in the train.  At Umballa I carried the news of
the bay mare's pedigree.'  After what he had seen in the garden, he was
not going to write of white stallions.

'Slower a little.  What has a bay mare to do ...  Is it Mahbub Ali, the
great dealer?'

'Who else?  I have been in his service.  Take more ink.  Again.  As the
order was, so I did it.  We then went on foot towards Benares, but on
the third day we found a certain regiment.  Is that down?'

'Ay, pulton,' murmured the writer, all ears.

'I went into their camp and was caught, and by means of the charm about
my neck, which thou knowest, it was established that I was the son of
some man in the regiment:  according to the prophecy of the Red Bull,
which thou knowest was common talk of our bazar.'  Kim waited for this
shaft to sink into the letter-writer's heart, cleared his throat, and
continued:  'A priest clothed me and gave me a new name ...  One
priest, however, was a fool.  The clothes are very heavy, but I am a
Sahib and my heart is heavy too.  They send me to a school and beat me.
I do not like the air and water here. Come then and help me, Mahbub
Ali, or send me some money, for I have not sufficient to pay the writer
who writes this.'

'"Who writes this."  It is my own fault that I was tricked.  Thou art
as clever as Husain Bux that forged the Treasury stamps at Nucklao.
But what a tale!  What a tale!  Is it true by any chance?'

'It does not profit to tell lies to Mahbub Ali.  It is better to help
his friends by lending them a stamp.  When the money comes I will
repay.'

The writer grunted doubtfully, but took a stamp out of his desk, sealed
the letter, handed it over to Kim, and departed.  Mahbub Ali's was a
name of power in Umballa.

'That is the way to win a good account with the Gods,' Kim shouted
after him.

'Pay me twice over when the money comes,' the man cried over his
shoulder.

'What was you bukkin' to that nigger about?'  said the drummer-boy when
Kim returned to the veranda.  'I was watch-in' you.'

'I was only talkin' to him.'

'You talk the same as a nigger, don't you?'

'No-ah!  No-ah!  I onlee speak a little.  What shall we do now?'

'The bugles'll go for dinner in arf a minute.  My Gawd!  I wish I'd
gone up to the Front with the Regiment.  It's awful doin' nothin' but
school down 'ere.  Don't you 'ate it?'

'Oah yess!'

I'd run away if I knew where to go to, but, as the men say, in this
bloomin' Injia you're only a prisoner at large.  You can't desert
without bein' took back at once.  I'm fair sick of it.'

'You have been in Be--England?'

'W'y, I only come out last troopin' season with my mother.  I should
think I 'ave been in England.  What a ignorant little beggar you are!
You was brought up in the gutter, wasn't you?'

'Oah yess.  Tell me something about England.  My father he came from
there.'

Though he would not say so, Kim of course disbelieved every word the
drummer-boy spoke about the Liverpool suburb which was his England.  It
passed the heavy time till dinner--a most unappetizing meal served to
the boys and a few invalids in a corner of a barrack-room.  But that he
had written to Mahbub Ali, Kim would have been almost depressed.  The
indifference of native crowds he was used to; but this strong
loneliness among white men preyed on him. He was grateful when, in the
course of the afternoon, a big soldier took him over to Father Victor,
who lived in another wing across another dusty parade-ground.  The
priest was reading an English letter written in purple ink.  He looked
at Kim more curiously than ever.

'An' how do you like it, my son, as far as you've gone?  Not much, eh?
It must be hard--very hard on a wild animal.  Listen now.  I've an
amazin' epistle from your friend.'

'Where is he?  Is he well?  Oah!  If he knows to write me letters, it
is all right.'

'You're fond of him then?'

'Of course I am fond of him.  He was fond of me.'

'It seems so by the look of this.  He can't write English, can he?'

'Oah no.  Not that I know, but of course he found a letter-writer who
can write English verree well, and so he wrote.  I do hope you
understand.'

'That accounts for it.  D'you know anything about his money affairs?'
Kim's face showed that he did not.

'How can I tell?'

'That's what I'm askin'.  Now listen if you can make head or tail o'
this.  We'll skip the first part ...  It's written from Jagadhir Road
...  "Sitting on wayside in grave meditation, trusting to be favoured
with your Honour's applause of present step, which recommend your
Honour to execute for Almighty God's sake.  Education is greatest
blessing if of best sorts.  Otherwise no earthly use." Faith, the old
man's hit the bull's-eye that time!  "If your Honour condescending
giving my boy best educations Xavier" (I suppose that's St Xavier's in
Partibus) "in terms of our conversation dated in your tent 15th
instant" (a business-like touch there!) "then Almighty God blessing
your Honour's succeedings to third an' fourth generation and"--now
listen!--"confide in your Honour's humble servant for adequate
remuneration per hoondi per annum three hundred rupees a year to one
expensive education St Xavier, Lucknow, and allow small time to forward
same per hoondi sent to any part of India as your Honour shall address
yourself.  This servant of your Honour has presently no place to lay
crown of his head, but going to Benares by train on account of
persecution of old woman talking so much and unanxious residing
Saharunpore in any domestic capacity."  Now what in the world does that
mean?'

'She has asked him to be her puro--her clergyman--at Saharunpore, I
think.  He would not do that on account of his River.  She did talk.'

'It's clear to you, is it?  It beats me altogether.  "So going to
Benares, where will find address and forward rupees for boy who is
apple of eye, and for Almighty God's sake execute this education, and
your petitioner as in duty bound shall ever awfully pray. Written by
Sobrao Satai, Failed Entrance Allahabad University, for Venerable
Teshoo Lama the priest of Such-zen looking for a River, address care of
Tirthankars' Temple, Benares.  P. M.--Please note boy is apple of eye,
and rupees shall be sent per hoondi three hundred per annum.  For God
Almighty's sake."  Now, is that ravin' lunacy or a business
proposition?  I ask you, because I'm fairly at my wits' end.'

'He says he will give me three hundred rupees a year?  So he will give
me them.'

'Oh, that's the way you look at it, is it?'

'Of course.  If he says so!'

The priest whistled; then he addressed Kim as an equal.  'I don't
believe it; but we'll see.  You were goin' off today to the Military
Orphanage at Sanawar, where the Regiment would keep you till you were
old enough to enlist.  Ye'd be brought up to the Church of England.
Bennett arranged for that.  On the other hand, if ye go to St Xavier's
ye'll get a better education an--an can have the religion.  D'ye see my
dilemma?  Kim saw nothing save a vision of the lama going south in a
train with none to beg for him.

'Like most people, I'm going to temporize.  If your friend sends the
money from Benares--Powers of Darkness below, where's a street-beggar
to raise three hundred rupees?--ye'll go down to Lucknow and I'll pay
your fare, because I can't touch the subscription-money if I intend, as
I do, to make ye a Catholic.  If he doesn't, ye'll go to the Military
Orphanage at the Regiment's expense.  I'll allow him three days' grace,
though I don't believe it at all.  Even then, if he fails in his
payments later on ...  but it's beyond me.  We can only walk one step
at a time in this world, praise God! An' they sent Bennett to the Front
an' left me behind.  Bennett can't expect everything.'

'Oah yess,' said Kim vaguely.

The priest leaned forward.  'I'd give a month's pay to find what's
goin' on inside that little round head of yours.'

'There is nothing,' said Kim, and scratched it.  He was wondering
whether Mahbub Ali would send him as much as a whole rupee.  Then he
could pay the letter-writer and write letters to the lama at Benares.
Perhaps Mahbub Ali would visit him next time he came south with horses.
Surely he must know that Kim's delivery of the letter to the officer at
Umballa had caused the great war which the men and boys had discussed
so loudly over the barrack dinner-tables. But if Mahbub Ali did not
know this, it would be very unsafe to tell him so.  Mahbub Ali was hard
upon boys who knew, or thought they knew, too much.

'Well, till I get further news'--Father Victor's voice interrupted the
reverie.  'Ye can run along now and play with the other boys. They'll
teach ye something--but I don't think ye'll like it.'

The day dragged to its weary end.  When he wished to sleep he was
instructed how to fold up his clothes and set out his boots; the other
boys deriding.  Bugles waked him in the dawn; the schoolmaster caught
him after breakfast, thrust a page of meaningless characters under his
nose, gave them senseless names and whacked him without reason.  Kim
meditated poisoning him with opium borrowed from a barrack-sweeper, but
reflected that, as they all ate at one table in public (this was
peculiarly revolting to Kim, who preferred to turn his back on the
world at meals), the stroke might be dangerous. Then he attempted
running off to the village where the priest had tried to drug the
lama--the village where the old soldier lived.  But far-seeing sentries
at every exit headed back the little scarlet figure. Trousers and
jacket crippled body and mind alike so he abandoned the project and
fell back, Oriental-fashion, on time and chance.  Three days of torment
passed in the big, echoing white rooms.  He walked out of afternoons
under escort of the drummer-boy, and all he heard from his companions
were the few useless words which seemed to make two-thirds of the white
man's abuse.  Kim knew and despised them all long ago.  The boy
resented his silence and lack of interest by beating him, as was only
natural.  He did not care for any of the bazars which were in bounds.
He styled all natives 'niggers'; yet servants and sweepers called him
abominable names to his face, and, misled by their deferential
attitude, he never understood.  This somewhat consoled Kim for the
beatings.

On the morning of the fourth day a judgement overtook that drummer.
They had gone out together towards Umballa racecourse.  He returned
alone, weeping, with news that young O'Hara, to whom he had been doing
nothing in particular, had hailed a scarlet-bearded nigger on
horseback; that the nigger had then and there laid into him with a
peculiarly adhesive quirt, picked up young O'Hara, and borne him off at
full gallop.  These tidings came to Father Victor, and he drew down his
long upper lip.  He was already sufficiently startled by a letter from
the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares, enclosing a native banker's
note of hand for three hundred rupees, and an amazing prayer to
'Almighty God'.  The lama would have been more annoyed than the priest
had he known how the bazar letter-writer had translated his phrase 'to
acquire merit.'

'Powers of Darkness below!'  Father Victor fumbled with the note. 'An'
now he's off with another of his peep-o'-day friends.  I don't know
whether it will be a greater relief to me to get him back or to have
him lost.  He's beyond my comprehension.  How the Divil--yes, he's the
man I mean--can a street-beggar raise money to educate white boys?'

Three miles off, on Umballa racecourse, Mahbub Ali, reining a grey
Kabuli stallion with Kim in front of him, was saying:

'But, Little Friend of all the World, there is my honour and reputation
to be considered.  All the officer-Sahibs in all the regiments, and all
Umballa, know Mahbub Ali.  Men saw me pick thee up and chastise that
boy.  We are seen now from far across this plain.  How can I take thee
away, or account for thy disappearing if I set thee down and let thee
run off into the crops?  They would put me in jail.  Be patient.  Once
a Sahib, always a Sahib.  When thou art a man--who knows?--thou wilt be
grateful to Mahbub Ali.'

'Take me beyond their sentries where I can change this red.  Give me
money and I will go to Benares and be with my lama again.  I do not
want to be a Sahib, and remember I did deliver that message.'

The stallion bounded wildly.  Mahbub Ali had incautiously driven home
the sharp-edged stirrup.  (He was not the new sort of fluent
horse-dealer who wears English boots and spurs.) Kim drew his own
conclusions from that betrayal.

'That was a small matter.  It lay on the straight road to Benares.  I
and the Sahib have by this time forgotten it.  I send so many letters
and messages to men who ask questions about horses, I cannot well
remember one from the other.  Was it some matter of a bay mare that
Peters Sahib wished the pedigree of?'

Kim saw the trap at once.  If he had said 'bay mare' Mahbub would have
known by his very readiness to fall in with the amendment that the boy
suspected something.  Kim replied therefore:

'Bay mare.  No.  I do not forget my messages thus.  It was a white
stallion.'

'Ay, so it was.  A white Arab stallion.  But thou didst write "bay
mare" to me.'

'Who cares to tell truth to a letter-writer?'  Kim answered, feeling
Mahbub's palm on his heart.

'Hi!  Mahbub, you old villain, pull up!'  cried a voice, and an
Englishman raced alongside on a little polo-pony.  'I've been chasing
you half over the country.  That Kabuli of yours can go.  For sale, I
suppose?'

'I have some young stuff coming on made by Heaven for the delicate and
difficult polo-game.  He has no equal.  He--'

'Plays polo and waits at table.  Yes.  We know all that.  What the
deuce have you got there?'

'A. boy,' said Mahbub gravely.  'He was being beaten by another boy.
His father was once a white soldier in the big war.  The boy was a
child in Lahore city.  He played with my horses when he was a babe. Now
I think they will make him a soldier.  He has been newly caught by his
father's Regiment that went up to the war last week.  But I do not
think he wants to be a soldier.  I take him for a ride.  Tell me where
thy barracks are and I will set thee there.'

'Let me go.  I can find the barracks alone.'

'And if thou runnest away who will say it is not my fault?'

'He'll run back to his dinner.  Where has he to run to?'  the
Englishman asked.

'He was born in the land.  He has friends.  He goes where he chooses.
He is a chabuk sawai [a sharp chap].  It needs only to change his
clothing, and in a twinkling he would be a low-caste Hindu boy.'

'The deuce he would!'  The Englishman looked critically at the boy as
Mahbub headed towards the barracks.  Kim ground his teeth.  Mahbub was
mocking him, as faithless Afghans will; for he went on:

'They will send him to a school and put heavy boots on his feet and
swaddle him in these clothes.  Then he will forget all he knows. Now,
which of the barracks is thine?'

Kim pointed--he could not speak--to Father Victor's wing, all staring
white near by.

'Perhaps he will make a good soldier,' said Mahbub reflectively.

'He will make a good orderly at least.  I sent him to deliver a message
once from Lahore.  A message concerning the pedigree of a white
stallion.'

Here was deadly insult on deadlier injury--and the Sahib to whom he had
so craftily given that war-waking letter heard it all.  Kim beheld
Mahbub Ali frying in flame for his treachery, but for himself he saw
one long grey vista of barracks, schools, and barracks again.  He gazed
imploringly at the clear-cut face in which there was no glimmer of
recognition; but even at this extremity it never occurred to him to
throw himself on the white man's mercy or to denounce the Afghan.  And
Mahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman, who stared as
deliberately at Kim, quivering and tongue-tied.

'My horse is well trained,' said the dealer.  'Others would have
kicked, Sahib.'

'Ah,' said the Englishman at last, rubbing his pony's damp withers with
his whip-butt.  'Who makes the boy a soldier?'

'He says the Regiment that found him, and especially the Padre-sahib of
that regiment.

'There is the Padre!'  Kim choked as bare-headed Father Victor sailed
down upon them from the veranda.

'Powers O' Darkness below, O'Hara!  How many more mixed friends do you
keep in Asia?'  he cried, as Kim slid down and stood helplessly before
him.

'Good morning, Padre,' the Englishman said cheerily.  'I know you by
reputation well enough.  Meant to have come over and called before
this.  I'm Creighton.'

'Of the Ethnological Survey?'  said Father Victor.  The Englishman
nodded.  'Faith, I'm glad to meet ye then; an' I owe you some thanks
for bringing back the boy.'

'No thanks to me, Padre.  Besides, the boy wasn't going away.  You
don't know old Mahbub Ali.'  The horse-dealer sat impassive in the
sunlight.  'You will when you have been in the station a month.  He
sells us all our crocks.  That boy is rather a curiosity.  Can you tell
me anything about him?'

'Can I tell you?'  puffed Father Victor.  'You'll be the one man that
could help me in my quandaries.  Tell you!  Powers o' Darkness, I'm
bursting to tell someone who knows something o' the native!'

A groom came round the corner.  Colonel Creighton raised his voice,
speaking in Urdu.  'Very good, Mahbub Ali, but what is the use of
telling me all those stories about the pony?  Not one pice more than
three hundred and fifty rupees will I give.'

'The Sahib is a little hot and angry after riding,' the horse-dealer
returned, with the leer of a privileged jester.  'Presently, he will
see my horse's points more clearly.  I will wait till he has finished
his talk with the Padre.  I will wait under that tree.'

'Confound you!'  The Colonel laughed.  'That comes of looking at one of
Mahbub's horses.  He's a regular old leech, Padre.  Wait, then, if thou
hast so much time to spare, Mahbub.  Now I'm at your service, Padre.
Where is the boy?  Oh, he's gone off to collogue with Mahbub. Queer
sort of boy.  Might I ask you to send my mare round under cover?'

He dropped into a chair which commanded a clear view of Kim and Mahbub
Ali in conference beneath the tree.  The Padre went indoors for
cheroots.

Creighton heard Kim say bitterly:  'Trust a Brahmin before a snake, and
a snake before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali.'

'That is all one.'  The great red beard wagged solemnly.  'Children
should not see a carpet on the loom till the pattern is made plain.
Believe me, Friend of all the World, I do thee great service.  They
will not make a soldier of thee.'

'You crafty old sinner!'  thought Creighton.  'But you're not far
wrong.  That boy mustn't be wasted if he is as advertised.'

'Excuse me half a minute,' cried the Padre from within, 'but I'm
gettin' the documents in the case.'

'If through me the favour of this bold and wise Colonel Sahib comes to
thee, and thou art raised to honour, what thanks wilt thou give Mahbub
Ali when thou art a man?'

'Nay, nay!  I begged thee to let me take the Road again, where I should
have been safe; and thou hast sold me back to the English. What will
they give thee for blood-money?'

'A cheerful young demon!'  The Colonel bit his cigar, and turned
politely to Father Victor.

'What are the letters that the fat priest is waving before the Colonel?
Stand behind the stallion as though looking at my bridle!' said Mahbub
Ali.

'A letter from my lama which he wrote from Jagadhir Road, saying that
he will pay three hundred rupees by the year for my schooling.'

'Oho!  Is old Red Hat of that sort?  At which school?'

'God knows.  I think in Nucklao.'

'Yes.  There is a big school there for the sons of Sahibs--and
half-Sahibs.  I have seen it when I sell horses there.  So the lama
also loved the Friend of all the World?'

'Ay; and he did not tell lies, or return me to captivity.'

'Small wonder the Padre does not know how to unravel the thread. How
fast he talks to the Colonel Sahib!'  Mahbub Ali chuckled.  'By Allah!'
the keen eyes swept the veranda for an Instant--'thy lama has sent what
to me looks like a note of hand.  I have had some few dealings in
hoondis.  The Colonel Sahib is looking at it.'

'What good is all this to me?'  said Kim wearily.  'Thou wilt go away,
and they will return me to those empty rooms where there is no good
place to sleep and where the boys beat me.'

'I do not think that.  Have patience, child.  All Pathans are not
faithless--except in horseflesh.'

Five--ten--fifteen minutes passed, Father Victor talking energetically
or asking questions which the Colonel answered.

'Now I've told you everything that I know about the boy from beginnin
to end; and it's a blessed relief to me.  Did ye ever hear the like?'

'At any rate, the old man has sent the money.  Gobind Sahai's notes of
hand are good from here to China,' said the Colonel.  'The more one
knows about natives the less can one say what they will or won't do.'

'That's consolin'--from the head of the Ethnological Survey.  It's this
mixture of Red Bulls and Rivers of Healing (poor heathen, God help
him!) an' notes of hand and Masonic certificates.  Are you a Mason, by
any chance?'

'By Jove, I am, now I come to think of it.  That's an additional
reason,' said the Colonel absently.

'I'm glad ye see a reason in it.  But as I said, it's the mixture o'
things that's beyond me.  An' his prophesyin' to our Colonel, sitting
on my bed with his little shimmy torn open showing his white skin; an'
the prophecy comin' true!  They'll cure all that nonsense at St
Xavier's, eh?'

'Sprinkle him with holy water,' the Colonel laughed.

'On my word, I fancy I ought to sometimes.  But I'm hoping he'll be
brought up as a good Catholic.  All that troubles me is what'll happen
if the old beggar-man--'

'Lama, lama, my dear sir; and some of them are gentlemen in their own
country.'

'The lama, then, fails to pay next year.  He's a fine business head to
plan on the spur of the moment, but he's bound to die some day. An'
takin' a heathen's money to give a child a Christian education--'

'But he said explicitly what he wanted.  As soon as he knew the boy was
white he seems to have made his arrangements accordingly.  I'd give a
month's pay to hear how he explained it all at the Tirthankars' Temple
at Benares.  Look here, Padre, I don't pretend to know much about
natives, but if he says he'll pay, he'll pay--dead or alive.  I mean,
his heirs will assume the debt.  My advice to you is, send the boy down
to Lucknow.  If your Anglican Chaplain thinks you've stolen a march on
him--'

'Bad luck to Bennett!  He was sent to the Front instead o' me. Doughty
certified me medically unfit.  I'll excommunicate Doughty if he comes
back alive!  Surely Bennett ought to be content with--'

'Glory, leaving you the religion.  Quite so!  As a matter of fact I
don't think Bennett will mind.  Put the blame on me.  I--er--strongly
recommend sending the boy to St Xavier's.  He can go down on pass as a
soldier's orphan, so the railway fare will be saved. You can buy him an
outfit from the Regimental subscription.  The Lodge will be saved the
expense of his education, and that will put the Lodge in a good temper.
It's perfectly easy.  I've got to go down to Lucknow next week.  I'll
look after the boy on the way--give him in charge of my servants, and
so on.'

'You're a good man.'

'Not in the least.  Don't make that mistake.  The lama has sent us
money for a definite end.  We can't very well return it.  We shall have
to do as he says.  Well, that's settled, isn't it?  Shall we say that,
Tuesday next, you'll hand him over to me at the night train south?
That's only three days.  He can't do much harm in three days.'

'It's a weight off my mind, but--this thing here?'--he waved the note
of hand--'I don't know Gobind Sahai:  or his bank, which may be a hole
in a wall.'

'You've never been a subaltern in debt.  I'll cash it if you like, and
send you the vouchers in proper order.'

'But with all your own work too!  It's askin'--'

'It's not the least trouble indeed.  You see, as an ethnologist, the
thing's very interesting to me.  I'd like to make a note of it for some
Government work that I'm doing.  The transformation of a regimental
badge like your Red Bull into a sort of fetish that the boy follows is
very interesting.'

'But I can't thank you enough.'

'There's one thing you can do.  All we Ethnological men are as jealous
as jackdaws of one another's discoveries.  They're of no interest to
anyone but ourselves, of course, but you know what book-collectors are
like.  Well, don't say a word, directly or indirectly, about the
Asiatic side of the boy's character--his adventures and his prophecy,
and so on.  I'll worm them out of the boy later on and--you see?'

'I do.  Ye'll make a wonderful account of it.  Never a word will I say
to anyone till I see it in print.'

'Thank you.  That goes straight to an ethnologist's heart.  Well, I
must be getting back to my breakfast.  Good Heavens!  Old Mahbub here
still?'  He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer came out from under
the shadow of the tree, 'Well, what is it?'

'As regards that young horse,' said Mahbub, 'I say that when a colt is
born to be a polo-pony, closely following the ball without
teaching--when such a colt knows the game by divination--then I say it
is a great wrong to break that colt to a heavy cart, Sahib!'

'So say I also, Mahbub.  The colt will be entered for polo only. (These
fellows think of nothing in the world but horses, Padre.) I'll see you
tomorrow, Mahbub, if you've anything likely for sale.'

The dealer saluted, horseman-fashion, with a sweep of the off hand. 'Be
patient a little, Friend of all the World,' he whispered to the
agonized Kim.  'Thy fortune is made.  In a little while thou goest to
Nucklao, and--here is something to pay the letter-writer. I shall see
thee again, I think, many times,' and he cantered off down the road.

'Listen to me,' said the Colonel from the veranda, speaking in the
vernacular.  'In three days thou wilt go with me to Lucknow, seeing and
hearing new things all the while.  Therefore sit still for three days
and do not run away.  Thou wilt go to school at Lucknow.'

'Shall I meet my Holy One there?'  Kim whimpered.

'At least Lucknow is nearer to Benares than Umballa.  It may be thou
wilt go under my protection.  Mahbub Ali knows this, and he will be
angry if thou returnest to the Road now.  Remember--much has been told
me which I do not forget.'

'I will wait,' said Kim, 'but the boys will beat me.'

Then the bugles blew for dinner.




Chapter 7


  Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised
  With idiot moons and stars retracing stars?
  Creep thou betweene--thy coming's all unnoised.
  Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars.
  Heir to these tumults, this affright, that fraye
  (By Adam's, fathers', own, sin bound alway);
  Peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say
  Which planet mends thy threadbare fate or mars?

  Sir John Christie.


In the afternoon the red-faced schoolmaster told Kim that he had been
'struck off the strength', which conveyed no meaning to him till he was
ordered to go away and play.  Then he ran to the bazar, and found the
young letter-writer to whom he owed a stamp.

'Now I pay,' said Kim royally, 'and now I need another letter to be
written.'

'Mahbub Ali is in Umballa,' said the writer jauntily.  He was, by
virtue of his office, a bureau of general misinformation.

'This is not to Mahbub, but to a priest.  Take thy pen and write
quickly.  To Teshoo Lama, the Holy One from Bhotiyal seeking for a
River, who is now in the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares.  Take
more ink!  In three days I am to go down to Nucklao to the school at
Nucklao.  The name of the school is Xavier.  I do not know where that
school is, but it is at Nucklao.'

'But I know Nucklao,' the writer interrupted.  'I know the school.'

'Tell him where it is, and I give half an anna.'

The reed pen scratched busily.  'He cannot mistake.'  The man lifted
his head.  'Who watches us across the street?'

Kim looked up hurriedly and saw Colonel Creighton in tennis-flannels.

'Oh, that is some Sahib who knows the fat priest in the barracks. He is
beckoning me.'

'What dost thou?'  said the Colonel, when Kim trotted up.

'I--I am not running away.  I send a letter to my Holy One at Benares.'

'I had not thought of that.  Hast thou said that I take thee to
Lucknow?'

'Nay, I have not.  Read the letter, if there be a doubt.'

'Then why hast thou left out my name in writing to that Holy One?' The
Colonel smiled a queer smile.  Kim took his courage in both hands.

'It was said once to me that it is inexpedient to write the names of
strangers concerned in any matter, because by the naming of names many
good plans are brought to confusion.'

'Thou hast been well taught,' the Colonel replied, and Kim flushed. 'I
have left my cheroot-case in the Padre's veranda.  Bring it to my house
this even.'

'Where is the house?'  said Kim.  His quick wit told him that he was
being tested in some fashion or another, and he stood on guard.

'Ask anyone in the big bazar.'  The Colonel walked on.

'He has forgotten his cheroot-case,' said Kim, returning.  'I must
bring it to him this evening.  That is all my letter except, thrice
over, Come to me!  Come to me!  Come to me!  Now I will pay for a stamp
and put it in the post.  He rose to go, and as an afterthought asked:
'Who is that angry-faced Sahib who lost the cheroot-case?'

'Oh, he is only Creighton Sahib--a very foolish Sahib, who is a Colonel
Sahib without a regiment.'

'What is his business?'

'God knows.  He is always buying horses which he cannot ride, and
asking riddles about the works of God--such as plants and stones and
the customs of people.  The dealers call him the father of fools,
because he is so easily cheated about a horse.  Mahbub Ali says he is
madder than most other Sahibs.'

'Oh!'  said Kim, and departed.  His training had given him some small
knowledge of character, and he argued that fools are not given
information which leads to calling out eight thousand men besides guns.
The Commander-in-Chief of all India does not talk, as Kim had heard him
talk, to fools.  Nor would Mahbub Ali's tone have changed, as it did
every time he mentioned the Colonel's name, if the Colonel had been a
fool.  Consequently--and this set Kim to skipping--there was a mystery
somewhere, and Mahbub Ali probably spied for the Colonel much as Kim
had spied for Mahbub.  And, like the horse-dealer, the Colonel
evidently respected people who did not show themselves to be too clever.


He rejoiced that he had not betrayed his knowledge of the Colonel's
house; and when, on his return to barracks, he discovered that no
cheroot-case had been left behind, he beamed with delight.  Here was a
man after his own heart--a tortuous and indirect person playing a
hidden game.  Well, if he could be a fool, so could Kim.

He showed nothing of his mind when Father Victor, for three long
mornings, discoursed to him of an entirely new set of Gods and
Godlings--notably of a Goddess called Mary, who, he gathered, was one
with Bibi Miriam of Mahbub Ali's theology.  He betrayed no emotion
when, after the lecture, Father Victor dragged him from shop to shop
buying articles of outfit, nor when envious drummer-boys kicked him
because he was going to a superior school did he complain, but awaited
the play of circumstances with an interested soul.  Father Victor, good
man, took him to the station, put him into an empty second-class next
to Colonel Creighton's first, and bade him farewell with genuine
feeling.

'They'll make a man o' you, O'Hara, at St Xavier's--a white man, an', I
hope, a good man.  They know all about your comin', an' the Colonel
will see that ye're not lost or mislaid anywhere on the road.  I've
given you a notion of religious matters,--at least I hope so,--and
you'll remember, when they ask you your religion, that you're a
Cath'lic.  Better say Roman Cath'lic, tho' I'm not fond of the word.'

Kim lit a rank cigarette--he had been careful to buy a stock in the
bazar--and lay down to think.  This solitary passage was very different
from that joyful down-journey in the third-class with the lama.
'Sahibs get little pleasure of travel,' he reflected.

'Hai mai!  I go from one place to another as it might be a kickball. It
is my Kismet.  No man can escape his Kismet.  But I am to pray to Bibi
Miriam, and I am a Sahib.'  He looked at his boots ruefully. 'No; I am
Kim.  This is the great world, and I am only Kim.  Who is Kim?'  He
considered his own identity, a thing he had never done before, till his
head swam.  He was one insignificant person in all this roaring whirl
of India, going southward to he knew not what fate.

Presently the Colonel sent for him, and talked for a long time.  So far
as Kim could gather, he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of
India as a chain-man.  If he were very good, and passed the proper
examinations, he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen
years old, and Colonel Creighton would see that he found suitable
employment.

Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this
talk.  Then the Colonel, seeing his mistake, turned to fluent and
picturesque Urdu and Kim was contented.  No man could be a fool who
knew the language so intimately, who moved so gently and silently, and
whose eyes were so different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs.

'Yes, and thou must learn how to make pictures of roads and mountains
and rivers, to carry these pictures in thine eye till a suitable time
comes to set them upon paper.  Perhaps some day, when thou art a
chain-man, I may say to thee when we are working together:  "Go across
those hills and see what lies beyond."  Then one will say:  "There are
bad people living in those hills who will slay the chain-man if he be
seen to look like a Sahib."  What then?'

Kim thought.  Would it be safe to return the Colonel's lead?

'I would tell what that other man had said.'

'But if I answered:  "I will give thee a hundred rupees for knowledge
of what is behind those hills--for a picture of a river and a little
news of what the people say in the villages there"?'

'How can I tell?  I am only a boy.  Wait till I am a man.'  Then,
seeing the Colonel's brow clouded, he went on:  'But I think I should
in a few days earn the hundred rupees.'

'By what road?'

Kim shook his head resolutely.  'If I said how I would earn them,
another man might hear and forestall me.  It is not good to sell
knowledge for nothing.'

'Tell now.'  The Colonel held up a rupee.  Kim's hand half reached
towards it, and dropped.

'Nay, Sahib; nay.  I know the price that will be paid for the answer,
but I do not know why the question is asked.'

'Take it for a gift, then,' said Creighton, tossing it over.  'There is
a good spirit in thee.  Do not let it be blunted at St Xavier's. There
are many boys there who despise the black men.'

'Their mothers were bazar-women,' said Kim.  He knew well there is no
hatred like that of the half-caste for his brother-in-law.

'True; but thou art a Sahib and the son of a Sahib.  Therefore, do not
at any time be led to contemn the black men.  I have known boys newly
entered into the service of the Government who feigned not to
understand the talk or the customs of black men.  Their pay was cut for
ignorance.  There is no sin so great as ignorance.  Remember this.'

Several times in the course of the long twenty-four hours' run south
did the Colonel send for Kim, always developing this latter text.

'We be all on one lead-rope, then,' said Kim at last, 'the Colonel,
Mahbub Ali, and I--when I become a chain-man.  He will use me as Mahbub
Ali employed me, I think.  That is good, if it allows me to return to
the Road again.  This clothing grows no easier by wear.'

When they came to the crowded Lucknow station there was no sign of the
lama.  He swallowed his disappointment, while the Colonel bundled him
into a ticca-gharri with his neat belongings and despatched him alone
to St Xavier's.

'I do not say farewell, because we shall meet again,' he cried. 'Again,
and many times, if thou art one of good spirit.  But thou art not yet
tried.'

'Not when I brought thee'--Kim actually dared to use the turn of
equals--'a white stallion's pedigree that night?'

'Much is gained by forgetting, little brother,' said the Colonel, with
a look that pierced through Kim's shoulder-blades as he scuttled into
the carriage.

It took him nearly five minutes to recover.  Then he sniffed the new
air appreciatively.  'A rich city,' he said.  'Richer than Lahore. How
good the bazars must be!  Coachman, drive me a little through the
bazars here.'

'My order is to take thee to the school.'  The driver used the 'thou',
which is rudeness when applied to a white man.  In the clearest and
most fluent vernacular Kim pointed out his error, climbed on to the
box-seat, and, perfect understanding established, drove for a couple of
hours up and down, estimating, comparing, and enjoying.  There is no
city--except Bombay, the queen of all--more beautiful in her garish
style than Lucknow, whether you see her from the bridge over the river,
or from the top of the Imambara looking down on the gilt umbrellas of
the Chutter Munzil, and the trees in which the town is bedded.  Kings
have adorned her with fantastic buildings, endowed her with charities,
crammed her with pensioners, and drenched her with blood.  She is the
centre of all idleness, intrigue, and luxury, and shares with Delhi the
claim to talk the only pure Urdu.

'A fair city--a beautiful city.'  The driver, as a Lucknow man, was
pleased with the compliment, and told Kim many astounding things where
an English guide would have talked of the Mutiny.

'Now we will go to the school,' said Kim at last.  The great old school
of St Xavier's in Partibus, block on block of low white buildings,
stands in vast grounds over against the Gumti River, at some distance
from the city.

'What like of folk are they within?'  said Kim.

'Young Sahibs--all devils.  But to speak truth, and I drive many of
them to and fro from the railway station, I have never seen one that
had in him the making of a more perfect devil than thou--this young
Sahib whom I am now driving.'

Naturally, for he was never trained to consider them in any way
improper, Kim had passed the time of day with one or two frivolous
ladies at upper windows in a certain street, and naturally, in the
exchange of compliments, had acquitted himself well.  He was about to
acknowledge the driver's last insolence, when his eye--it was growing
dusk--caught a figure sitting by one of the white plaster gate-pillars
in the long sweep of wall.

'Stop!'  he cried.  'Stay here.  I do not go to the school at once.'

'But what is to pay me for this coming and re-coming?'  said the driver
petulantly.  'Is the boy mad?  Last time it was a dancing-girl. This
time it is a priest.'

Kim was in the road headlong, patting the dusty feet beneath the dirty
yellow robe.

'I have waited here a day and a half,' the lama's level voice began.
'Nay, I had a disciple with me.  He that was my friend at the Temple of
the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey.  I came from Benares
in the te-rain, when thy letter was given me.  Yes, I am well fed.  I
need nothing.'

'But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman, O Holy One?  In what
way didst thou get to Benares?  My heart has been heavy since we
parted.'

'The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for
children.  I separated myself from that company, permitting her to
acquire merit by gifts.  She is at least a woman of open hands, and I
made a promise to return to her house if need arose.  Then, perceiving
myself alone in this great and terrible world, I bethought me of the
te-rain to Benares, where I knew one abode in the Tirthankars' Temple
who was a Seeker, even as I.'

'Ah!  Thy River,' said Kim.  'I had forgotten the River.'

'So soon, my chela?  I have never forgotten it.  But when I had left
thee it seemed better that I should go to the Temple and take counsel,
for, look you, India is very large, and it may be that wise men before
us, some two or three, have left a record of the place of our River.
There is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some
saying one thing, and some another.  They are courteous folk.'

'So be it; but what dost thou do now?'

'I acquire merit in that I help thee, my chela, to wisdom.  The priest
of that body of men who serve the Red Bull wrote me that all should be
as I desired for thee.  I sent the money to suffice for one year, and
then I came, as thou seest me, to watch for thee going up into the
Gates of Learning.  A day and a half have I waited, not because I was
led by any affection towards thee--that is no part of the Way--but, as
they said at the Tirthankars' Temple, because, money having been paid
for learning, it was right that I should oversee the end of the matter.
They resolved my doubts most clearly.  I had a fear that, perhaps, I
came because I wished to see thee--misguided by the Red Mist of
affection.  It is not so ... Moreover, I am troubled by a dream.'

'But surely, Holy One, thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that
befell on it.  Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come?'

'The horses are cold, and it is past their feeding-time,' whined the
driver.

'Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt!'  Kim
snarled over his shoulder.  'I am all alone in this land; I know not
where I go nor what shall befall me.  My heart was in that letter I
sent thee.  Except for Mahbub Ali, and he is a Pathan, I have no friend
save thee, Holy One.  Do not altogether go away.'

'I have considered that also,' the lama replied, in a shaking voice.
'It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if before
that I have not found my River--by assuring myself that thy feet are
set on wisdom.  What they will teach thee I do not know, but the priest
wrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than
thou.  So from time to time, therefore, I will come again.  Maybe thou
wilt be such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles'--the lama
wiped them elaborately--'in the Wonder House at Lahore.  That is my
hope, for he was a Fountain of Wisdom--wiser than many abbots ....
Again, maybe thou wilt forget me and our meetings.'

'If I eat thy bread,' cried Kim passionately, 'how shall I ever forget
thee?'

'No--no.'  He put the boy aside.  'I must go back to Benares.  From
time to time, now that I know the customs of letter-writers in this
land, I will send thee a letter, and from time to time I will come and
see thee.'

'But whither shall I send my letters?'  wailed Kim, clutching at the
robe, all forgetful that he was a Sahib.

'To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares.  That is the place I have
chosen till I find my River.  Do not weep; for, look you, all Desire is
Illusion and a new binding upon the Wheel.  Go up to the Gates of
Learning.  Let me see thee go ...  Dost thou love me?  Then go, or my
heart cracks ...  I will come again.  Surely I will come again.

The lama watched the ticca-gharri rumble into the compound, and strode
off, snuffing between each long stride.

'The Gates of Learning' shut with a clang.

The country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs, which do
not resemble those of any other land; and his teachers approach him by
roads which an English master would not understand. Therefore, you
would scarcely be interested in Kim's experiences as a St Xavier's boy
among two or three hundred precocious youths, most of whom had never
seen the sea.  He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of
bounds when there was cholera in the city.  This was before he had
learned to write fair English, and so was obliged to find a bazar
letter-writer.  He was, of course, indicted for smoking and for the use
of abuse more full-flavoured than even St Xavier's had ever heard.  He
learned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the
native-born, who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty.
He played the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs
in the sleeping-rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights
telling tales till the dawn; and quietly he measured himself against
his self-reliant mates.

They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway, Telegraph, and
Canal Services; of warrant-officers, sometimes retired and sometimes
acting as commanders-in-chief to a feudatory Rajah's army; of captains
of the Indian Marine Government pensioners, planters, Presidency
shopkeepers, and missionaries.  A few were cadets of the old Eurasian
houses that have taken strong root in Dhurrumtollah--Pereiras, De
Souzas, and D'Silvas.  Their parents could well have educated them in
England, but they loved the school that had served their own youth, and
generation followed sallow-hued generation at St Xavier's.  Their homes
ranged from Howrah of the railway people to abandoned cantonments like
Monghyr and Chunar; lost tea-gardens Shillong-way; villages where their
fathers were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan; Mission-stations
a week from the nearest railway line; seaports a thousand miles south,
facing the brazen Indian surf; and cinchona-plantations south of all.
The mere story of their adventures, which to them were no adventures,
on their road to and from school would have crisped a Western boy's
hair.  They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles of
jungle, where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed
by tigers; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in
an English August than their brothers across the world would have lain
still while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin.  There were boys of
fifteen who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a
flooded river, taking charge, as by right, of a camp of frantic
pilgrims returning from a shrine.  There were seniors who had
requisitioned a chance-met Rajah's elephant, in the name of St Francis
Xavier, when the Rains once blotted out the cart-track that led to
their father's estate, and had all but lost the huge beast in a
quicksand.  There was a boy who, he said, and none doubted, had helped
his father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in
the days when those head-hunters were bold against lonely plantations.

And every tale was told in the even, passionless voice of the
native-born, mixed with quaint reflections, borrowed unconsciously from
native foster-mothers, and turns of speech that showed they had been
that instant translated from the vernacular.  Kim watched, listened,
and approved.  This was not insipid, single-word talk of drummer-boys.
It dealt with a life he knew and in part understood. The atmosphere
suited him, and he throve by inches.  They gave him a white drill suit
as the weather warmed, and he rejoiced in the new-found bodily comforts
as he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks they set him.
His quickness would have delighted an English master; but at St
Xavier's they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and
surroundings, as they know the half-collapse that sets in at twenty-two
or twenty-three.

None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly.  When tales were
told of hot nights, Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences;
for St Xavier's looks down on boys who 'go native all-together.'  One
must never forget that one is a Sahib, and that some day, when
examinations are passed, one will command natives. Kim made a note of
this, for he began to understand where examinations led.

Then came the holidays from August to October--the long holidays
imposed by the heat and the Rains.  Kim was informed that he would go
north to some station in the hills behind Umballa, where Father Victor
would arrange for him.

'A barrack-school?'  said Kim, who had asked many questions and thought
more.

'Yes, I suppose so,' said the master.  'It will not do you any harm to
keep you out of mischief.  You can go up with young De Castro as far as
Delhi.'

Kim considered it in every possible light.  He had been diligent, even
as the Colonel advised.  A boy's holiday was his own property--of so
much the talk of his companions had advised him,--and a barrack-school
would be torment after St Xavier's.  Moreover--this was magic worth
anything else--he could write.  In three months he had discovered how
men can speak to each other without a third party, at the cost of half
an anna and a little knowledge.  No word had come from the lama, but
there remained the Road.  Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud
squishing up between the toes, as his mouth watered for mutton stewed
with butter and cabbages, for rice speckled with strong scented
cardamoms, for the saffron-tinted rice, garlic and onions, and the
forbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars.  They would feed him raw
beef on a platter at the barrack-school, and he must smoke by stealth.
But again, he was a Sahib and was at St Xavier's, and that pig Mahbub
Ali ...  No, he would not test Mahbub's hospitality--and yet ...  He
thought it out alone in the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he
had been unjust to Mahbub.

The school was empty; nearly all the masters had gone away; Colonel
Creighton's railway pass lay in his hand, and Kim puffed himself that
he had not spent Colonel Creighton's or Mahbub's money in riotous
living.  He was still lord of two rupees seven annas.  His new
bullock-trunk, marked 'K. O'H.', and bedding-roll lay in the empty
sleeping-room.

'Sahibs are always tied to their baggage,' said Kim, nodding at them.
'You will stay here' He went out into the warm rain, smiling sinfully,
and sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time
before...

'Arre'!  Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter? Oh,
shame!'

'Was I born yesterday?'  Kim squatted native-fashion on the cushions of
that upper room.  'A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help
out a jest.  Is it much to ask?'

'Who is she?  Thou art full young, as Sahibs go, for this devilry.'

'Oh, she?  She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment
in the cantonments.  He has beaten me twice because I went over their
wall in these clothes.  Now I would go as a gardener's boy.  Old men
are very jealous.'

'That is true.  Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice.'

'Not too black, Naikan.  I would not appear to her as a hubshi
(nigger).'

'Oh, love makes nought of these things.  And how old is she?'

'Twelve years, I think,' said the shameless Kim.  'Spread it also on
the breast.  It may be her father will tear my clothes off me, and if I
am piebald--' he laughed.

The girl worked busily, dabbing a twist of cloth into a little saucer
of brown dye that holds longer than any walnut-juice.

'Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban.  Woe is me, my head is
all unshaved!  And he will surely knock off my turban.'

'I am not a barber, but I will make shift.  Thou wast born to be a
breaker of hearts!  All this disguise for one evening?  Remember, the
stuff does not wash away.'  She shook with laughter till her bracelets
and anklets jingled.  'But who is to pay me for this? Huneefa herself
could not have given thee better stuff.'

'Trust in the Gods, my sister,' said Kim gravely, screwing his face
round as the stain dried.  'Besides, hast thou ever helped to paint a
Sahib thus before?'

'Never indeed.  But a jest is not money.'

'It is worth much more.'

'Child, thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan
that I have ever known to take up a poor girl's time with this play,
and then to say:  "Is not the jest enough?"  Thou wilt go very far in
this world.'  She gave the dancing-girls' salutation in mockery.

'All one.  Make haste and rough-cut my head.'  Kim shifted from foot to
foot, his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before
him.  He gave the girl four annas, and ran down the stairs in the
likeness of a low-caste Hindu boy--perfect in every detail.  A cookshop
was his next point of call, where he feasted in extravagance and greasy
luxury.

On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro, all covered
with prickly-heat, get into a second-class compartment.  Kim patronized
a third, and was the life and soul of it.  He explained to the company
that he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with
fever, and that he would pick up his master at Umballa.  As the
occupants of the carriage changed, he varied this tale, or adorned it
with all the shoots of a budding fancy, the more rampant for being held
off native speech so long.  In all India that night was no human being
so joyful as Kim.  At Umballa he got out and headed eastward, plashing
over the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived.

About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by
wire that young O'Hara had disappeared.  Mahbub Ali was in town selling
horses, and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning
cantering round Annandale racecourse.

'Oh, that is nothing,' said the horse-dealer.  'Men are like horses. At
certain times they need salt, and if that salt is not in the mangers
they will lick it up from the earth.  He has gone back to the Road
again for a while.  The madrissak wearied him.  I knew it would.
Another time, I will take him upon the Road myself.  Do not be
troubled, Creighton Sahib.  It is as though a polo-pony, breaking
loose, ran out to learn the game alone.'

'Then he is not dead, think you?'

'Fever might kill him.  I do not fear for the boy otherwise.  A monkey
does not fall among trees.'

Next morning, on the same course, Mahbub's stallion ranged alongside
the Colonel.

'It is as I had thought,' said the horse-dealer.  'He has come through
Umballa at least, and there he has written a letter to me, having
learned in the bazar that I was here.'

'Read,' said the Colonel, with a sigh of relief.  It was absurd that a
man of his position should take an interest in a little country-bred
vagabond; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train, and
often in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer,
silent, self-possessed boy.  His evasion, of course, was the height of
insolence, but it argued some resource and nerve.

Mahbub's eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped
little plain, where none could come near unseen.

'"The Friend of the Stars, who is the Friend of all the World--"'

'What is this?'

'A name we give him in Lahore city.  "The Friend of all the World takes
leave to go to his own places.  He will come back upon the appointed
day.  Let the box and the bedding-roll be sent for; and if there has
been a fault, let the Hand of Friendship turn aside the Whip of
Calamity."  There is yet a little more, but--'

'No matter, read.'

'"Certain things are not known to those who eat with forks.  It is
better to eat with both hands for a while.  Speak soft words to those
who do not understand this that the return may be propitious."  Now the
manner in which that was cast is, of course, the work of the
letter-writer, but see how wisely the boy has devised the matter of it
so that no hint is given except to those who know!'

'Is this the Hand of Friendship to avert the Whip of Calamity?' laughed
the Colonel.

'See how wise is the boy.  He would go back to the Road again, as I
said.  Not knowing yet thy trade--'

'I am not at all sure of that,' the Colonel muttered.

'He turns to me to make a peace between you.  Is he not wise?  He says
he will return.  He is but perfecting his knowledge.  Think, Sahib!  He
has been three months at the school.  And he is not mouthed to that
bit.  For my part, I rejoice.  The pony learns the game.'

'Ay, but another time he must not go alone.'

'Why?  He went alone before he came under the Colonel Sahib's
protection.  When he comes to the Great Game he must go alone--alone,
and at peril of his head.  Then, if he spits, or sneezes, or sits down
other than as the people do whom he watches, he may be slain.  Why
hinder him now?  Remember how the Persians say:  The jackal that lives
in the wilds of Mazanderan can only be caught by the hounds of
Mazanderan.'

'True.  It is true, Mahbub Ali.  And if he comes to no harm, I do not
desire anything better.  But it is great insolence on his part.'

'He does not tell me, even, whither he goes,' said Mahbub.  'He is no
fool.  When his time is accomplished he will come to me.  It is time
the healer of pearls took him in hand.  He ripens too quickly--as
Sahibs reckon.'

This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later.  Mahbub had
gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses, and Kim
met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone, begged an alms of him,
was sworn at, and replied in English.  There was nobody within earshot
to hear Mahbub's gasp of amazement.

'Oho!  And where hast thou been?'

'Up and down--down and up.'

'Come under a tree, out of the wet, and tell.'

'I stayed for a while with an old man near Umballa; anon with a
household of my acquaintance in Umballa.  With one of these I went as
far as Delhi to the southward.  That is a wondrous city.  Then I drove
a bullock for a teli [an oilman] coming north; but I heard of a great
feast forward in Patiala, and thither went I in the company of a
firework-maker.  It was a great feast' (Kim rubbed his stomach).  'I
saw Rajahs, and elephants with gold and silver trappings; and they lit
all the fireworks at once, whereby eleven men were killed, my
fire-work-maker among them, and I was blown across a tent but took no
harm.  Then I came back to the rel with a Sikh horseman, to whom I was
groom for my bread; and so here.'

'Shabash!'  said Mahbub Ali.

'But what does the Colonel Sahib say?  I do not wish to be beaten.'

'The Hand of Friendship has averted the Whip of Calamity; but another
time, when thou takest the Road it will be with me.  This is too early.'

'Late enough for me.  I have learned to read and to write English a
little at the madrissah.  I shall soon be altogether a Sahib.'

'Hear him!'  laughed Mahbub, looking at the little drenched figure
dancing in the wet.  'Salaam--Sahib,' and he saluted ironically.

'Well, art tired of the Road, or wilt thou come on to Umballa with me
and work back with the horses?'

'I come with thee, Mahbub Ali.'




Chapter 8


  Something I owe to the soil that grew--
  More to the life that fed--
  But most to Allah Who gave me two
  Separate sides to my head.

  I would go without shirts or shoes,
  Friends, tobacco or bread
  Sooner than for an instant lose
  Either side of my head.'

  The Two-Sided Man.


'Then in God's name take blue for red,' said Mahbub, alluding to the
Hindu colour of Kim's disreputable turban.

Kim countered with the old proverb, 'I will change my faith and my
bedding, but thou must pay for it.'

The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse.  At a shop on
the outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up,
externally at least, a Mohammedan.

Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked
meal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats [balushai we call
it] and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.

'This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,' said
Kim, grinning as he squatted, 'and assuredly they give no such victuals
at my madrissah.'

'I have a desire to hear of that same madrissah.'  Mahbub stuffed
himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage
and golden-brown onions.  'But tell me first, altogether and
truthfully, the manner of thy escape.  For, O Friend of all the
World,'--he loosed his cracking belt--'I do not think it is often that
a Sahib and the son of a Sahib runs away from there.'

'How should they?  They do not know the land.  It was nothing,' said
Kim, and began his tale.  When he came to the disguisement and the
interview with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali's gravity went from
him.  He laughed aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.

'Shabash!  Shabash!  Oh, well done, little one!  What will the healer
of turquoises say to this?  Now, slowly, let us hear what befell
afterwards--step by step, omitting nothing.'

Step by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the
full-flavoured tobacco caught his lungs.

'I said,' growled Mahbub Ali to himself, 'I said it was the pony
breaking out to play polo.  The fruit is ripe already--except that he
must learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his
compasses.  Listen now.  I have turned aside the Colonel's whip from
thy skin, and that is no small service.'

'True.'  Kim pulled serenely.  'That is true.'

'But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way
good.'

'It was my holiday, Hajji.  I was a slave for many weeks.  Why should I
not run away when the school was shut?  Look, too, how I, living upon
my friends or working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved
the Colonel Sahib a great expense.'

Mahbub's lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.

'What are a few rupees'--the Pathan threw out his open hand
carelessly--'to the Colonel Sahib?  He spends them for a purpose, not
in any way for love of thee.'

'That,' said Kim slowly, 'I knew a very long time ago.'

'Who told?'

'The Colonel Sahib himself.  Not in those many words, but plainly
enough for one who is not altogether a mud-head.  Yea, he told me in
the te-rain when we went down to Lucknow.'

'Be it so.  Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though
in the telling I lend thee my head.'

'It was forfeit to me,' said Kim, with deep relish, 'in Umballa, when
thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me.'

'Speak a little plainer.  All the world may tell lies save thou and I.
For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger
here.'

'And this is known to me also,' said Kim, readjusting the live
charcoal-ball on the weed.  'It is a very sure tie between us. Indeed,
thy hold is surer even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to
death, or, it may be, thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people
here and in Simla and across the passes behind the Hills would, on the
other hand, say:  "What has come to Mahbub Ali?" if he were found dead
among his horses.  Surely, too, the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries.
But again,'--Kim's face puckered with cunning,--'he would not make
overlong inquiry, lest people should ask:  "What has this Colonel Sahib
to do with that horse-dealer?" But I--if I lived--'

'As thou wouldst surely die--'

'Maybe; but I say, if I lived, I, and I alone, would know that one had
come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Ali's bulkhead in
the serai, and there had slain him, either before or after that thief
had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the soles of his
slippers.  Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he say to
me--(I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case that he
had not left behind him)--"What is Mahbub Ali to me?"?'

Up went a gout of heavy smoke.  There was a long pause:  then Mahbub
Ali spoke in admiration:  'And with these things on thy mind, dost thou
lie down and rise again among all the Sahibs' little sons at the
madrissah and meekly take instruction from thy teachers?'

'It is an order,' said Kim blandly.  'Who am I to dispute an order?'

'A most finished Son of Eblis,' said Mahbub Ali.  'But what is this
tale of the thief and the search?'

'That which I saw,' said Kim, 'the night that my lama and I lay next
thy place in the Kashmir Seral.  The door was left unlocked, which I
think is not thy custom, Mahbub.  He came in as one assured that thou
wouldst not soon return.  My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank.
He searched as it were for something--not a rug, not stirrups, nor a
bridle, nor brass pots--something little and most carefully hid.  Else
why did he prick with an iron between the soles of thy slippers?'

'Ha!'  Mahbub Ali smiled gently.  'And seeing these things, what tale
didst thou fashion to thyself, Well of the Truth?'

'None.  I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my
skin, and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had
bitten out of a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa
perceiving that a heavy trust was laid upon me.  At that hour, had I
chosen, thy head was forfeit.  It needed only to say to that man, "I
have here a paper concerning a horse which I cannot read."  And then?'
Kim peered at Mahbub under his eyebrows.

'Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice--perhaps thrice, afterwards.
I do not think more than thrice,' said Mahbub simply.

'It is true.  I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I
loved thee, Mahbub.  Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but
(and this thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what
Colonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion's
pedigree.'

'And what did he?'  for Kim had bitten off the conversation.

'Dost thou give news for love, or dost thou sell it?'  Kim asked.

'I sell and--I buy.'  Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt and
held it up.

'Eight!'  said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of the
East.

Mahbub laughed, and put away the coin.  'It is too easy to deal in that
market, Friend of all the World.  Tell me for love.  Our lives lie in
each other's hand.'

'Very good.  I saw the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief] come
to a big dinner.  I saw him in Creighton Sahib's office.  I saw the two
read the white stallion's pedigree.  I heard the very orders given for
the opening of a great war.'

'Hah!'  Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire.  'The game is well
played.  That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the
flower--thanks to me--and thee.  What didst thou later?'

'I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among
the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama.  But I bore
away the old man's purse, and the Brahmin found nothing.  So next
morning he was angry.  Ho!  Ho!  And I also used the news when I fell
into the hands of that white Regiment with their Bull!'

'That was foolishness.'  Mahbub scowled.  'News is not meant to be
thrown about like dung-cakes, but used sparingly--like bhang.'

'So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good.  But that was
very long ago,' he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown
hand--'and since then, and especially in the nights under the punkah at
the madrissah, I have thought very greatly.'

'Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born's thought might have
led?'  said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet
beard.

'It is permitted,' said Kim, and threw back the very tone.  'They say
at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a
fault.'

Mahbub's hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a 'black man'
[kala admi] is a blood-insult.  Then he remembered and laughed. 'Speak,
Sahib.  Thy black man hears.'

'But,' said Kim, 'I am not a Sahib, and I say I made a fault to curse
thee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was betrayed
by a Pathan.  I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and I wished
to kill that low-caste drummer-boy.  I say now, Hajji, that it was well
done; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service.  I will
stay in the madrissah till I am ripe.'

'Well said.  Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of
using compasses to be learned in that game.  One waits in the Hills
above to show thee.'

'I will learn their teaching upon a condition--that my time is given to
me without question when the madrissah is shut.  Ask that for me of the
Colonel.'

'But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs' tongue?'

'The Colonel is the servant of the Government.  He is sent hither and
yon at a word, and must consider his own advancement.  (See how much I
have already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since
three months only.  I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years.  So!  To
the madrissah I will go.  At the madrissah I will learn.  In the
madrissah I will be a Sahib.  But when the madrissah is shut, then must
I be free and go among my people.  Otherwise I die!'

'And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?'

'This great and beautiful land,' said Kim, waving his paw round the
little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily
through the tobacco-smoke.  'And, further, I would see my lama again.
And, further, I need money.'

'That is the need of everyone,' said Mahbub ruefully.  'I will give
thee eight annas, for much money is not picked out of horses' hooves,
and it must suffice for many days.  As to all the rest, I am well
pleased, and no further talk is needed.  Make haste to learn, and in
three years, or it may be less, thou wilt be an aid--even to me.'

'Have I been such a hindrance till now?'  said Kim, with a boy's giggle.

'Do not give answers,' Mahbub grunted.  'Thou art my new horse-boy. Go
and bed among my men.  They are near the north end of the station, with
the horses.'

'They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without
authority.'

Mahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink, and
dabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper.  From Balkh to
Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running
diagonally across it.

'That is enough to show my headman.  I come in the morning.'

'By which road?'  said Kim.

'By the road from the city.  There is but one, and then we return to
Creighton Sahib.  I have saved thee a beating.'

'Allah!  What is a beating when the very head is loose on the
shoulders?'

Kim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house,
keeping close to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile
or so.  Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for
he needed time to invent a story if any of Mahbub's retainers asked
questions.

They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and,
being natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which
Mahbub's animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by
the Bombay tram-company.  The headman, a broken-down,
consumptive-looking Mohammedan, promptly challenged Kim, but was
pacified at sight of Mahbub's sign-manual.

'The Hajji has of his favour given me service,' said Kim testily. 'If
this be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning.  Meantime, a place
by the fire.'

Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must
raise on every occasion.  It died down, and Kim lay out behind the
little knot of Mahbub's followers, almost under the wheels of a
horse-truck, a borrowed blanket for covering.  Now a bed among
brickbats and ballast-refuse on a damp night, between overcrowded
horses and unwashed Baltis, would not appeal to many white boys; but
Kim was utterly happy.  Change of scene, service, and surroundings were
the breath of his little nostrils, and thinking of the neat white cots
of St Xavier's all arow under the punkah gave him joy as keen as the
repetition of the multiplication-table in English.

'I am very old,' he thought sleepily.  'Every month I become a year
more old.  I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbub's
message to Umballa.  Even when I was with that white Regiment I was
very young and small and had no wisdom.  But now I learn every day, and
in three years the Colonel will take me out of the madrissah and let me
go upon the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses' pedigrees, or maybe I
shall go by myself; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him.
Yes; that is best.  To walk again as a chela with my lama when he comes
back to Benares.'

The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly.  He was plunging into
a beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp,
above the monotonous babble round the fire.  It came from behind the
iron-skinned horse-truck.

'He is not here, then?'

'Where should he be but roystering in the city.  Who looks for a rat in
a frog-pond?  Come away.  He is not our man.'

'He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time.  It is the order.'

'Hire some woman to drug him.  It is a few rupees only, and there is no
evidence.'

'Except the woman.  It must be more certain; and remember the price
upon his head.'

'Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border.
If it were in Peshawur, now!'

'Yes--in Peshawur,' the second voice sneered.  'Peshawur, full of his
blood-kin--full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will
hide.  Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.'

'Then what is the plan?'

'O fool, have I not told it a hundred times?  Wait till he comes to lie
down, and then one sure shot.  The trucks are between us and pursuit.
We have but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not
see whence the shot came.  Wait here at least till the dawn.  What
manner of fakir art thou, to shiver at a little watching?'

'Oho!'  thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes.  'Once again it is Mahbub.
Indeed a white stallion's pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to
Sahibs!  Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news.  Now what is to
do, Kim?  I know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before
the dawn they will shoot him.  That would be no profit for thee, Kim.
And this is not a matter for the police.  That would be no profit for
Mahbub; and'--he giggled almost aloud--'I do not remember any lesson at
Nucklao which will help me.  Allah!  Here is Kim and yonder are they.
First, then, Kim must wake and go away, so that they shall not suspect.
A bad dream wakes a man--thus--'

He threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with the
terrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare.

'Urr-urr-urr-urr!  Ya-la-la-la-la!  Narain!  The churel!  The churel!'

A churel is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in
child-bed.  She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards on
the ankles, and she leads men to torment.

Louder rose Kim's quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet
and staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them.
Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care
that the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed
himself.  After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away
into the thick darkness.

He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind
it, his chin on a level with the coping-stone.  Here he could command
all the night-traffic, himself unseen.

Two or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing
policeman and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off
evil spirits.  Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.

'Ah!  This is more like Mahbub,' thought Kim, as the beast shied at the
little head above the culvert.

'Ohe', Mahbub Ali,' he whispered, 'have a care!'

The horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards
the culvert.

'Never again,' said Mahbub, 'will I take a shod horse for night-work.
They pick up all the bones and nails in the city.'  He stooped to lift
its forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kim's.

'Down--keep down,' he muttered.  'The night is full of eyes.'

'Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks.  They will shoot thee
at thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head.  I heard,
sleeping near the horses.'

'Didst thou see them?  ...  Hold still, Sire of Devils!'  This
furiously to the horse.

'No.'

'Was one dressed belike as a fakir?'

'One said to the other, "What manner of fakir art thou, to shiver at a
little watching?"'

'Good.  Go back to the camp and lie down.  I do not die tonight.'

Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished.  Kim tore back down the ditch
till he reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped
across the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket.

'At least Mahbub knows,' he thought contentedly.  'And certainly he
spoke as one expecting it.  I do not think those two men will profit by
tonight's watch.'

An hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all
night, he slept deeply.  Now and again a night train roared along the
metals within twenty feet of him; but he had all the Oriental's
indifference to mere noise, and it did not even weave a dream through
his slumber.

Mahbub was anything but asleep.  It annoyed him vehemently that people
outside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him
for the life.  His first and natural impulse was to cross the line
lower down, work up again, and, catching his well-wishers from behind,
summarily slay them.  Here, he reflected with sorrow, another branch of
the Government, totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton, might
demand explanations which would be hard to supply; and he knew that
south of the Border a perfectly ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse
or so.  He had not been troubled in this way since he sent Kim to
Umballa with the message, and hoped that suspicion had been finally
diverted.

Then a most brilliant notion struck him.

'The English do eternally tell the truth,' he said, 'therefore we of
this country are eternally made foolish.  By Allah, I will tell the
truth to an Englishman!  Of what use is the Government police if a poor
Kabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks.  This is as bad as
Peshawur!  I should lay a complaint at the station.  Better still, some
young Sahib on the Railway!  They are zealous, and if they catch
thieves it is remembered to their honour.'

He tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the platform.

'Hullo, Mahbub Ali' said a young Assistant District Traffic
Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line--a tall, tow-haired,
horsey youth in dingy white linen.  'What are you doing here?  Selling
weeds--eh?'

'No; I am not troubled for my horses.  I come to look for Lutuf Ullah.
I have a truck-load up the line.  Could anyone take them out without
the Railway's knowledge?'

'Shouldn't think so, Mahbub.  You can claim against us if they do.'

'I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks
nearly all night.  Fakirs do not steal horses, so I gave them no more
thought.  I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.'

'The deuce you did?  And you didn't bother your head about it?  'Pon my
word, it's just almost as well that I met you.  What were they like,
eh?'

'They were only fakirs.  They will no more than take a little grain,
perhaps, from one of the trucks.  There are many up the line.  The
State will never miss the dole.  I came here seeking for my partner,
Lutuf Ullah.'

'Never mind your partner.  Where are your horse-trucks?'

'A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for
the trains.'--

'The signal-box!  Yes.'

'And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand
side--looking up the line thus.  But as regards Lutuf Ullah--a tall man
with a broken nose, and a Persian greyhound Aie!'

The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman;
for, as he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the
goods-yard.  Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.

'They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will
wonder why there are no fakirs.  They are very clever boys--Barton
Sahib and Young Sahib.'

He waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the
line girt for action.  A light engine slid through the station, and he
caught a glimpse of young Barton in the cab.

'I did that child an injustice.  He is not altogether a fool,' said
Mahbub Ali.  'To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!'

When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth
while to tell him any news of the night.  No one, at least, but one
small horseboy, newly advanced to the great man's service, whom Mahbub
called to his tiny tent to assist in some packing.

'It is all known to me,' whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags. 'Two
Sahibs came up on a te-train.  I was running to and fro in the dark on
this side of the trucks as the te-train moved up and down slowly.  They
fell upon two men sitting under this truck--Hajji, what shall I do with
this lump of tobacco?  Wrap it in paper and put it under the salt-bag?
Yes--and struck them down.  But one man struck at a Sahib with a
fakir's buck's horn' (Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns, which
are a fakir's sole temporal weapon)--'the blood came.  So the other
Sahib, first smiting his own man senseless, smote the stabber with a
short gun which had rolled from the first man's hand.  They all raged
as though mad together.'

Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation.  'No!  That is not so much
dewanee [madness, or a case for the civil court--the word can be punned
upon both ways] as nizamut [a criminal case].  A gun, sayest thou?  Ten
good years in jail.'

'Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they
were put on the te-train.  Their heads moved thus.  And there is much
blood on the line.  Come and see?'

'I have seen blood before.  Jail is the sure place--and assuredly they
will give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long
time.  They were unfriends of mine.  Thy fate and mine seem on one
string.  What a tale for the healer of pearls!  Now swiftly with the
saddle-bags and the cooking-platter.  We will take out the horses and
away to Simla.'

Swiftly--as Orientals understand speed--with long explanations, with
abuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little
things forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff
and fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept
dawn.  Kim, regarded as Mahbub Ali's favourite by all who wished to
stand well with the Pathan, was not called upon to work.  They strolled
on by the easiest of stages, halting every few hours at a wayside
shelter.  Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub
Ali says, every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a
horse, and, though he be over head in debt to the money-lender, must
make as if to buy.  That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib, rolling
along in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk.  Some would even
descend from their vehicles and feel the horses' legs; asking inane
questions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly
insulting the imperturbable trader.

'When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib
was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner's
camping-ground for spite,' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his
pipe under a tree, 'I did not know how greatly they were fools, and
this made me wroth.  As thus--,' and he told Kim a tale of an
expression, misused in all innocence, that doubled Kim up with mirth.
'Now I see, however,'--he exhaled smoke slowly--'that it is with them
as with all men--in certain matters they are wise, and in others most
foolish.  Very foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger; for
though the heart may be clean of offence, how is the stranger to know
that?  He is more like to search truth with a dagger.'

'True.  True talk,' said Kim solemnly.  'Fools speak of a cat when a
woman is brought to bed, for instance.  I have heard them.'

'Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee to
remember this with both kinds of faces.  Among Sahibs, never forgetting
thou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou
art--' He paused, with a puzzled smile.

'What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist?  That is a hard knot.'

'Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be
damned.  So says my Law--or I think it does.  But thou art also my
Little Friend of all the World, and I love thee.  So says my heart.
This matter of creeds is like horseflesh.  The wise man knows horses
are good--that there is a profit to be made from all; and for
myself--but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah--I could
believe the same of all the Faiths.  Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare
taken from the sands of her birthplace and removed to the west of
Bengal founders--nor is even a Balkh stallion (and there are no better
horses than those of Balkh, were they not so heavy in the shoulder) of
any account in the great Northern deserts beside the snow-camels I have
seen.  Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the horses.
Each has merit in its own country.'

'But my lama said altogether a different thing.'

'Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal.  My heart is a
little angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such
worth in a man so little known.'

'It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is
drawn.'

'And his to thine, I hear.  Hearts are like horses.  They come and they
go against bit or spur.  Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that
bay stallion's pickets more firmly.  We do not want a horse-fight at
every resting-stage, and the dun and the black will be locked in a
little ...  Now hear me.  Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart
to see that lama?'

'It is one part of my bond,' said Kim.  'If I do not see him, and if he
is taken from me, I will go out of that madrissah in Nucklao and,
and--once gone, who is to find me again?'

'It is true.  Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.'
Mahbub nodded his head.

'Do not be afraid.'  Kim spoke as though he could have vanished on the
moment.  'My lama has said that he will come to see me at the
madrissah--'

'A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa--'

'Not all!'  Kim cut in with a snort.  'Their eyes are blued and their
nails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them.  Sons of
mehteranees--brothers-in-law to the bhungi [sweeper].'

We need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little
point clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the while.

'Friend of all the World,' said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for the
boy to clean, 'I have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few
Sahibs.  I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.'

'And why?  When I always tell thee the truth.'

'Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest men.'
Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and went
over to the horses.

'Or sell it?'

There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn.  'What new
devilry?'

'Eight annas, and I will tell,' said Kim, grinning.  'It touches thy
peace.'

'O Shaitan!'  Mahbub gave the money.

'Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down
yonder at Umballa?'

'Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten.  Why?'

'Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?'

'I will twist thy ears in a moment--Sahib.'

'No need--Pathan.  Only, the second fakir, whom the Sahibs beat
senseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore.  I
saw his face as they helped him on the engine.  The very same man.'

'Why didst thou not tell before?'

'Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years.  There is no need
to tell more than is necessary at any one time.  Besides, I did not
then need money for sweetmeats.'

'Allah kerim!'  said Mahbub Ah.  'Wilt thou some day sell my head for a
few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?'

Kim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa,
through Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla.  A sudden
spate in the Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be
sure), and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders.  Farther up
the road the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant, and being
in high condition of grass food, it cost a day and a half to get them
together again.  Then they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few
unsaleable screws--remnants of his string--and Mahbub, who has more of
horse-coping in his little fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his
tents, must needs buy two of the worst, and that meant eight hours'
laborious diplomacy and untold tobacco.  But it was all pure
delight--the wandering road, climbing, dipping, and sweeping about the
growing spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows;
the branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides; the voices
of a thousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the solemn
deodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped branches; the
vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them; the incessant twanging
of the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga
swung round a curve; the halts for prayers (Mahbub was very religious
in dry-washings and bellowings when time did not press); the evening
conferences by the halting-places, when camels and bullocks chewed
solemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the Road--all
these things lifted Kim's heart to song within him.

'But, when the singing and dancing is done,' said Mahbub Ali, 'comes
the Colonel Sahib's, and that is not so sweet.'

'A fair land--a most beautiful land is this of Hind--and the land of
the Five Rivers is fairer than all,' Kim half chanted.  'Into it I will
go again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me.
Once gone, who shall find me?  Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of
Simla?  Allah, what a city!'

'My father's brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahib's well
was new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two houses in it.'

He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar--the
crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall
at an angle of forty-five.  A man who knows his way there can defy all
the police of India's summer capital, so cunningly does veranda
communicate with veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with
bolt-hole.  Here live those who minister to the wants of the glad
city--jhampanis who pull the pretty ladies' 'rickshaws by night and
gamble till the dawn; grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors,
firewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets, and native employees of the
Government.  Here are discussed by courtesans the things which are
supposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council; and here
gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States.  Here, too,
Mahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead
at Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer.  It was a place
of miracles, too, for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy,
and there came out an hour later a Eurasian lad--the Lucknow girl's dye
was of the best--in badly-fitting shop-clothes.

'I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,' quoth Mahbub Ali, 'and a second
time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity.  He says
that thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is
too late, therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.'

'I have said that my holidays are my own.  I do not go to school twice
over.  That is one part of my bond.'

'The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract.  Thou art to
lodge in Lurgan Sahib's house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.'

'I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.'

'Thou dost not know the honour.  Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee.
Thou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must
forget for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub
Ali, who sells horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know.
Remember this order.'

Kim nodded.  'Good,' said he, 'and who is Lurgan Sahib?  Nay'--he
caught Mahbub's sword-keen glance--'indeed I have never heard his name.
Is he by chance--he lowered his voice--'one of us?'

'What talk is this of us, Sahib?'  Mahbub Ali returned, in the tone he
used towards Europeans.  'I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and the son
of a Sahib.  Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All
Simla knows it.  Ask there ...  and, Friend of all the World, he is one
to be obeyed to the last wink of his eyelashes.  Men say he does magic,
but that should not touch thee.  Go up the hill and ask. Here begins
the Great Game.'




Chapter 9


  S' doaks was son of Yelth the wise--
  Chief of the Raven clan.
  Itswoot the Bear had him in care
  To make him a medicine-man.

  He was quick and quicker to learn--
  Bold and bolder to dare:
  He danced the dread Kloo-Kwallie Dance
  To tickle Itswoot the Bear!

  Oregon Legend


Kim flung himself whole-heartedly upon the next turn of the wheel. He
would be a Sahib again for a while.  In that idea, so soon as he had
reached the broad road under Simla Town Hall, he cast about for one to
impress.  A Hindu child, some ten years old, squatted under a lamp-post.

'Where is Mr Lurgan's house?'  demanded Kim.

'I do not understand English,' was the answer, and Kim shifted his
speech accordingly.

'I will show.'

Together they set off through the mysterious dusk, full of the noises
of a city below the hillside, and the breath of a cool wind in
deodar-crowned Jakko, shouldering the stars.  The house-lights,
scattered on every level, made, as it were, a double firmament. Some
were fixed, others belonged to the 'rickshaws of the careless,
open-spoken English folk, going out to dinner.

'It is here,' said Kim's guide, and halted in a veranda flush with the
main road.  No door stayed them, but a curtain of beaded reeds that
split up the lamplight beyond.

'He is come,' said the boy, in a voice little louder than a sigh, and
vanished.  Kim felt sure that the boy had been posted to guide him from
the first, but, putting a bold face on it, parted the curtain.  A
black-bearded man, with a green shade over his eyes, sat at a table,
and, one by one, with short, white hands, picked up globules of light
from a tray before him, threaded them on a glancing silken string, and
hummed to himself the while.  Kim was conscious that beyond the circle
of light the room was full of things that smelt like all the temples of
all the East.  A whiff of musk, a puff of sandal-wood, and a breath of
sickly jessamine-oil caught his opened nostrils.

'I am here,' said Kim at last, speaking in the vernacular:  the smells
made him forget that he was to be a Sahib.

'Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one,' the man counted to himself,
stringing pearl after pearl so quickly that Kim could scarcely follow
his fingers.  He slid off the green shade and looked fixedly at Kim for
a full half-minute.  The pupils of the eye dilated and closed to
pin-pricks, as if at will.  There was a fakir by the Taksali Gate who
had just this gift and made money by it, especially when cursing silly
women.  Kim stared with interest.  His disreputable friend could
further twitch his ears, almost like a goat, and Kim was disappointed
that this new man could not imitate him.

'Do not be afraid,' said Lurgan Sahib suddenly.

'Why should I fear?'

'Thou wilt sleep here tonight, and stay with me till it is time to go
again to Nucklao.  It is an order.'

'It is an order,' Kim repeated.  'But where shall I sleep?'

'Here, in this room.'  Lurgan Sahib waved his hand towards the darkness
behind him.

'So be it,' said Kim composedly.  'Now?'

He nodded and held the lamp above his head.  As the light swept them,
there leaped out from the walls a collection of Tibetan devil-dance
masks, hanging above the fiend-embroidered draperies of those ghastly
functions--horned masks, scowling masks, and masks of idiotic terror.
In a corner, a Japanese warrior, mailed and plumed, menaced him with a
halberd, and a score of lances and khandas and kuttars gave back the
unsteady gleam.  But what interested Kim more than all these things--he
had seen devil-dance masks at the Lahore Museum--was a glimpse of the
soft-eyed Hindu child who had left him in the doorway, sitting
cross-legged under the table of pearls with a little smile on his
scarlet lips.

'I think that Lurgan Sahib wishes to make me afraid.  And I am sure
that that devil's brat below the table wishes to see me afraid.

'This place,' he said aloud, 'is like a Wonder House.  Where is my bed?'

Lurgan Sahib pointed to a native quilt in a corner by the loathsome
masks, picked up the lamp, and left the room black.

'Was that Lurgan Sahib?'  Kim asked as he cuddled down.  No answer. He
could hear the Hindu boy breathing, however, and, guided by the sound,
crawled across the floor, and cuffed into the darkness, crying:  'Give
answer, devil!  Is this the way to lie to a Sahib?'

From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle. It
could not be his soft-fleshed companion, because he was weeping. So Kim
lifted up his voice and called aloud:

'Lurgan Sahib!  O Lurgan Sahib!  Is it an order that thy servant does
not speak to me?'

'It is an order.'  The voice came from behind him and he started.

'Very good.  But remember,' he muttered, as he resought the quilt, 'I
will beat thee in the morning.  I do not love Hindus.'

That was no cheerful night; the room being overfull of voices and
music.  Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name.  The second
time he set out in search, and ended by bruising his nose against a box
that certainly spoke with a human tongue, but in no sort of human
accent.  It seemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to
a smaller box on the floor--so far, at least, as he could judge by
touch.  And the voice, very hard and whirring, came out of the trumpet.
Kim rubbed his nose and grew furious, thinking, as usual, in Hindi.

'This with a beggar from the bazar might be good, but--I am a Sahib and
the son of a Sahib and, which is twice as much more beside, a student
of Nucklao.  Yess' (here he turned to English), 'a boy of St Xavier's.
Damn Mr Lurgan's eyes!--It is some sort of machinery like a
sewing-machine.  Oh, it is a great cheek of him--we are not frightened
that way at Lucknow--No!'  Then in Hindi: 'But what does he gain?  He
is only a trader--I am in his shop.  But Creighton Sahib is a
Colonel--and I think Creighton Sahib gave orders that it should be
done.  How I will beat that Hindu in the morning!  What is this?'

The trumpet-box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse
that even Kim had ever heard, in a high uninterested voice, that for a
moment lifted the short hairs of his neck.  When the vile thing drew
breath, Kim was reassured by the soft, sewing-machine-like whirr.

'Chup!  [Be still]' he cried, and again he heard a chuckle that decided
him.  'Chup--or I break your head.'

The box took no heed.  Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something
lifted with a click.  He had evidently raised a lid.  If there were a
devil inside, now was its time, for--he sniffed--thus did the
sewing-machines of the bazar smell.  He would clean that shaitan.  He
slipped off his jacket, and plunged it into the box's mouth. Something
long and round bent under the pressure, there was a whirr and the voice
stopped--as voices must if you ram a thrice-doubled coat on to the wax
cylinder and into the works of an expensive phonograph.  Kim finished
his slumbers with a serene mind.

In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him.

'Oah!'  said Kim, firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib-dom.  'There
was a box in the night that gave me bad talk.  So I stopped it.  Was it
your box?'

The man held out his hand.

'Shake hands, O'Hara,' he said.  'Yes, it was my box.  I keep such
things because my friends the Rajahs like them.  That one is broken,
but it was cheap at the price.  Yes, my friends, the Kings, are very
fond of toys--and so am I sometimes.'

Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes.  He was a Sahib in
that he wore Sahib's clothes; the accent of his Urdu, the intonation of
his English, showed that he was anything but a Sahib. He seemed to
understand what moved in Kim's mind ere the boy opened his mouth, and
he took no pains to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow
masters.  Sweetest of all--he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic
side.

'I am sorry you cannot beat my boy this morning.  He says he will kill
you with a knife or poison.  He is jealous, so I have put him in the
corner and I shall not speak to him today.  He has just tried to kill
me.  You must help me with the breakfast.  He is almost too jealous to
trust, just now.'

Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do
over this tale.  Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was
used to record his little affairs in the North.

The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside, and
they looked down into their neighbours' chimney-pots, as is the custom
of Simla.  But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan
Sahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim.  The Lahore Museum
was larger, but here were more wonders--ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels
from Tibet; turquoise and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles;
curiously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets;
the devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies;
gilt figures of Buddha, and little portable lacquer altars; Russian
samovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint
octagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes--from Japan of all places
in the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales, smelling
atrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical
work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper
incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic
devils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw
hide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds,
and a thousand other oddments were cased, or piled, or merely thrown
into the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table,
where Lurgan Sahib worked.

'Those things are nothing,' said his host, following Kim's glance. 'I
buy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sell--if I like the
buyer's look.  My work is on the table--some of it.'

It blazed in the morning light--all red and blue and green flashes,
picked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and
there.  Kim opened his eyes.

'Oh, they are quite well, those stones.  It will not hurt them to take
the sun.  Besides, they are cheap.  But with sick stones it is very
different.'  He piled Kim's plate anew.  'There is no one but me can
doctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises.  I grant you opals--any
fool can cure an opal--but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I
were to die!  Then there would be no one ...  Oh no!  You cannot do
anything with jewels.  It will be quite enough if you understand a
little about the Turquoise--some day.'

He moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay
water-jug from the filter.

'Do you want drink?'

Kim nodded.  Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on the jar.
Next instant, it stood at Kim's elbow, full to within half an inch of
the brim--the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it
had slid into place.

'Wah!'  said Kim in most utter amazement.  'That is magic.'  Lurgan
Sahib's smile showed that the compliment had gone home.

'Throw it back.'

'It will break.'

'I say, throw it back.'

Kim pitched it at random.  It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces,
while the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.

'I said it would break.'

'All one.  Look at it.  Look at the largest piece.'

That lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on the
floor.  Kim looked intently.  Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the
nape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: 'Look!  It
shall come to life again, piece by piece.  First the big piece shall
join itself to two others on the right and the left--on the right and
the left.  Look!'

To save his life, Kim could not have turned his head.  The light touch
held him as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him.
There was one large piece of the jar where there had been three, and
above them the shadowy outline of the entire vessel.  He could see the
veranda through it, but it was thickening and darkening with each beat
of his pulse.  Yet the jar--how slowly the thoughts came!--the jar had
been smashed before his eyes. Another wave of prickling fire raced down
his neck, as Lurgan Sahib moved his hand.

'Look!  It is coming into shape,' said Lurgan Sahib.

So far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and
with an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself
half out of the water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was
swallowing it and took refuge in--the multiplication-table in English!

'Look!  It is coming into shape,' whispered Lurgan Sahib.

The jar had been smashed--yess, smashed--not the native word, he would
not think of that--but smashed--into fifty pieces, and twice three was
six, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve.  He
clung desperately to the repetition.  The shadow-outline of the jar
cleared like a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards;
there was the spilt water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of
the veranda showed, all ribbed, the white house-wall below--and thrice
twelve was thirty-six!

'Look!  Is it coming into shape?'  asked Lurgan Sahib.

'But it is smashed--smashed,' he gasped--Lurgan Sahib had been
muttering softly for the last half-minute.  Kim wrenched his head
aside.  'Look!  Dekho!  It is there as it was there.'

'It is there as it was there,' said Lurgan, watching Kim closely while
the boy rubbed his neck.  'But you are the first of many who has ever
seen it so.'  He wiped his broad forehead.

'Was that more magic?'  Kim asked suspiciously.  The tingle had gone
from his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.

'No, that was not magic.  It was only to see if there was--a flaw in a
jewel.  Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man
holds them in his hand, and knows the proper way.  That is why one must
be careful before one sets them.  Tell me, did you see the shape of the
pot?'

'For a little time.  It began to grow like a flower from the ground.'

'And then what did you do?  I mean, how did you think?'

'Oah!  I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I
thought--and it was broken.'

'Hm!  Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?'

'If it was,' said Kim 'do you think I should let it again?  I should
run away.'

'And now you are not afraid--eh?'

'Not now.'

Lurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever.  'I shall ask Mahbub
Ali--not now, but some day later,' he muttered.  'I am pleased with
you--yes; and I am pleased with you--no.  You are the first that ever
saved himself.  I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right.
You should not tell that--not even to me.'

He turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table,
rubbing his hands softly.  A small, husky sob came from behind a pile
of carpets.  It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall.
His thin shoulders worked with grief.

'Ah!  He is jealous, so jealous.  I wonder if he will try to poison me
again in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.

'Kubbee--kubbee nahin [Never--never.  No!]', came the broken answer.

'And whether he will kill this other boy?'


'Kubbee--kubbee nahin.'

'What do you think he will do?'  He turned suddenly on Kim.

'Oah!  I do not know.  Let him go, perhaps.  Why did he want to poison
you?'

'Because he is so fond of me.  Suppose you were fond of someone, and
you saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased
with him than he was with you, what would you do?'

Kim thought.  Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular. 'I
should not poison that man,' said Kim reflectively, 'but I should beat
that boy--if that boy was fond of my man.  But first, I would ask that
boy if it were true.'

'Ah!  He thinks everyone must be fond of me.'

'Then I think he is a fool.'

'Hearest thou?'  said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders.  'The
Sahib's son thinks thou art a little fool.  Come out, and next time thy
heart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely the
Devil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day!  It might have made
me ill, child, and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels.
Come!'

The child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale
and flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib's feet, with an
extravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim.

'I will look into the ink-pools--I will faithfully guard the jewels!
Oh, my Father and my Mother, send him away!'  He indicated Kim with a
backward jerk of his bare heel.

'Not yet--not yet.  In a little while he will go away again.  But now
he is at school--at a new madrissah--and thou shalt be his teacher.
Play the Play of the Jewels against him.  I will keep tally.'

The child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop,
whence he returned with a copper tray.

'Give me!'  he said to Lurgan Sahib.  'Let them come from thy hand, for
he may say that I knew them before.'

'Gently--gently,' the man replied, and from a drawer under the table
dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.

'Now,' said the child, waving an old newspaper.  'Look on them as long
as thou wilt, stranger.  Count and, if need be, handle.  One look is
enough for me.'  He turned his back proudly.

'But what is the game?'

'When thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst
remember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell
over the tally to Lurgan Sahib.  I will write mine.'

'Oah!'  The instinct of competition waked in his breast.  He bent over
the tray.  There were but fifteen stones on it.  'That is easy,' he
said after a minute.  The child slipped the paper over the winking
jewels and scribbled in a native account-book.

'There are under that paper five blue stones--one big, one smaller, and
three small,' said Kim, all in haste.  'There are four green stones,
and one with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see
through, and one like a pipe-stem.  There are two red stones,
and--and--I made the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten.  No!
Give me time.  One was of ivory, little and brownish; and--and--give me
time...'

'One--two'--Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten.  Kim shook his head.

'Hear my count!'  the child burst in, trilling with laughter. 'First,
are two flawed sapphires--one of two ruttees and one of four as I
should judge.  The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge.  There
is one Turkestan turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two
inscribed--one with a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked
across, for it came out of an old ring, I cannot read.  We have now all
five blue stones.  Four flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled
in two places, and one is a little carven-'

'Their weights?'  said Lurgan Sahib impassively.

'Three--five--five--and four ruttees as I judge it.  There is one piece
of old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is one
ruby of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a
balas-ruby, flawed, of two ruttees.  There is a carved ivory from China
representing a rat sucking an egg; and there is last--ah ha!--a ball of
crystal as big as a bean set on a gold leaf.'

He clapped his hands at the close.

'He is thy master,' said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.

'Huh!  He knew the names of the stones,' said Kim, flushing.  'Try
again!  With common things such as he and I both know.'

They heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop,
and even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled.

'Bind my eyes--let me feel once with my fingers, and even then I will
leave thee opened-eyed behind,' he challenged.

Kim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.

'If it were men--or horses,' he said, 'I could do better.  This playing
with tweezers and knives and scissors is too little.'

'Learn first--teach later,' said Lurgan Sahib.  'Is he thy master?'

'Truly.  But how is it done?'

'By doing it many times over till it is done perfectly--for it is worth
doing.'

The Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back.

'Do not despair,' he said.  'I myself will teach thee.'

'And I will see that thou art well taught,' said Lurgan Sahib, still
speaking in the vernacular, 'for except my boy here--it was foolish of
him to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have
given it--except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one
better worth teaching.  And there are ten days more ere thou canst
return to Lucknao where they teach nothing--at the long price.  We
shall, I think, be friends.'

They were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself too much to
reflect on their craziness.  In the morning they played the Jewel
Game--sometimes with veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords
and daggers, sometimes with photo-graphs of natives.  Through the
afternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop, sitting
dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurgan's many and
very curious visitors.  There were small Rajahs, escorts coughing in
the veranda, who came to buy curiosities--such as phonographs and
mechanical toys.  There were ladies in search of necklaces, and men, it
seemed to Kim--but his mind may have been vitiated by early
training--in search of the ladies; natives from independent and
feudatory Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken
necklaces--rivers of light poured out upon the table--but whose true
end seemed to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs.
There were Babus to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and
authority, but at the end of each interview he gave them money in
coined silver and currency notes. There were occasional gatherings of
long-coated theatrical natives who discussed metaphysics in English and
Bengali, to Mr Lurgan's great edification.  He was always interested in
religions.  At the end of the day, Kim and the Hindu boy--whose name
varied at Lurgan's pleasure--were expected to give a detailed account
of all that they had seen and heard--their view of each man's
character, as shown in his face, talk, and manner, and their notions of
his real errand.  After dinner, Lurgan Sahib's fancy turned more to
what might be called dressing-up, in which game he took a most
informing interest.  He could paint faces to a marvel; with a brush-dab
here and a line there changing them past recognition.  The shop was
full of all manner of dresses and turbans, and Kim was apparelled
variously as a young Mohammedan of good family, an oilman, and
once--which was a joyous evening--as the son of an Oudh landholder in
the fullest of full dress.  Lurgan Sahib had a hawk's eye to detect the
least flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn teak-wood couch, would
explain by the half-hour together how such and such a caste talked, or
walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and, since 'hows' matter
little in this world, the 'why' of everything.  The Hindu child played
this game clumsily.  That little mind, keen as an icicle where tally of
jewels was concerned, could not temper itself to enter another's soul;
but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put on the changing
dresses, and changed speech and gesture therewith.

Carried away by enthusiasm, he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one
evening how the disciples of a certain caste of fakir, old Lahore
acquaintances, begged doles by the roadside; and what sort of language
he would use to an Englishman, to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair, and
to a woman without a veil.  Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely, and begged
Kim to stay as he was, immobile for half an hour--cross-legged,
ash-smeared, and wild-eyed, in the back room. At the end of that time
entered a hulking, obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat, and
Kim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff.  Lurgan Sahib--this
annoyed Kim--watched the Babu and not the play.

'I think,' said the Babu heavily, lighting a cigarette, 'I am of
opeenion that it is most extraordinary and effeecient performance.
Except that you had told me I should have opined that--that--that you
were pulling my legs.  How soon can he become approximately effeecient
chain-man?  Because then I shall indent for him.'

'That is what he must learn at Lucknow.'

'Then order him to be jolly-dam'-quick.  Good-night, Lurgan.'  The Babu
swung out with the gait of a bogged cow.

When they were telling over the day's list of visitors, Lurgan Sahib
asked Kim who he thought the man might be.

'God knows!'  said Kim cheerily.  The tone might almost have deceived
Mahbub Ali, but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls.

'That is true.  God, He knows; but I wish to know what you think.'

Kim glanced sideways at his companion, whose eye had a way of
compelling truth.

'I--I think he will want me when I come from the school,
but'--confidentially, as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval--'I do not
understand how he can wear many dresses and talk many tongues.'

'Thou wilt understand many things later.  He is a writer of tales for a
certain Colonel.  His honour is great only in Simla, and it is
noticeable that he has no name, but only a number and a letter--that is
a custom among us.'

'And is there a price upon his head too--as upon Mah--all the others?'

'Not yet; but if a boy rose up who is now sitting here and went--look,
the door is open!--as far as a certain house with a red-painted
veranda, behind that which was the old theatre in the Lower Bazar, and
whispered through the shutters:  "Hurree Chunder Mookerjee bore the bad
news of last month", that boy might take away a belt full of rupees.'

'How many?'  said Kim promptly.

'Five hundred--a thousand--as many as he might ask for.'

'Good.  And for how long might such a boy live after the news was
told?'  He smiled merrily at Lurgan's Sahib's very beard.

'Ah!  That is to be well thought of.  Perhaps if he were very clever,
he might live out the day--but not the night.  By no means the night.'

'Then what is the Babu's pay if so much is put upon his head?'

'Eighty--perhaps a hundred--perhaps a hundred and fifty rupees; but the
pay is the least part of the work.  From time to time, God causes men
to be born--and thou art one of them--who have a lust to go abroad at
the risk of their lives and discover news--today it may be of far-off
things, tomorrow of some hidden mountain, and the next day of some
near-by men who have done a foolishness against the State.  These souls
are very few; and of these few, not more than ten are of the best.
Among these ten I count the Babu, and that is curious.  How great,
therefore, and desirable must be a business that brazens the heart of a
Bengali!'

'True.  But the days go slowly for me.  I am yet a boy, and it is only
within two months I learned to write Angrezi.  Even now I cannot read
it well.  And there are yet years and years and long years before I can
be even a chain-man.'

'Have patience, Friend of all the World'--Kim started at the title.
'Would I had a few of the years that so irk thee.  I have proved thee
in several small ways.  This will not be forgotten when I make my
report to the Colonel Sahib.'  Then, changing suddenly into English
with a deep laugh:

'By Jove!  O'Hara, I think there is a great deal in you; but you must
not become proud and you must not talk.  You must go back to Lucknow
and be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and
perhaps, next holidays if you care, you can come back to me!'  Kim's
face fell.  'Oh, I mean if you like.  I know where you want to go.'

Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the
rear of a Kalka tonga.  His companion was the whale-like Babu, who,
with a fringed shawl wrapped round his head, and his fat
openwork-stockinged left leg tucked under him, shivered and grunted in
the morning chill.

'How comes it that this man is one of us?'  thought Kim considering the
jelly back as they jolted down the road; and the reflection threw him
into most pleasant day-dreams.  Lurgan Sahib had given him five
rupees--a splendid sum--as well as the assurance of his protection if
he worked.  Unlike Mahbub, Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of
the reward that would follow obedience, and Kim was content.  If only,
like the Babu, he could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number--and
a price upon his head!  Some day he would be all that and more.  Some
day he might be almost as great as Mahbub Ali!  The housetops of his
search should be half India; he would follow Kings and Ministers, as in
the old days he had followed vakils and lawyers' touts across Lahore
city for Mahbub Ali's sake. Meantime, there was the present, and not at
all unpleasant, fact of St Xavier's immediately before him.  There
would be new boys to condescend to, and there would be tales of holiday
adventures to hear.  Young Martin, son of the tea-planter at Manipur,
had boasted that he would go to war, with a rifle, against the
head-hunters.

That might be, but it was certain young Martin had not been blown half
across the forecourt of a Patiala palace by an explosion of fireworks;
nor had he...  Kim fell to telling himself the story of his own
adventures through the last three months.  He could paralyse St
Xavier's--even the biggest boys who shaved--with the recital, were that
permitted.  But it was, of course, out of the question. There would be
a price upon his head in good time, as Lurgan Sahib had assured him;
and if he talked foolishly now, not only would that price never be set,
but Colonel Creighton would cast him off--and he would be left to the
wrath of Lurgan Sahib and Mahbub Ali--for the short space of life that
would remain to him.

'So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish,' was his proverbial
philosophy.  It behoved him to forget his holidays (there would always
remain the fun of inventing imaginary adventures) and, as Lurgan Sahib
had said, to work.  Of all the boys hurrying back to St Xavier's, from
Sukkur in the sands to Galle beneath the palms, none was so filled with
virtue as Kimball O'Hara, jiggeting down to Umballa behind Hurree
Chunder Mookerjee, whose name on the books of one section of the
Ethnological Survey was R.17.

And if additional spur were needed, the Babu supplied it.  After a huge
meal at Kalka, he spoke uninterruptedly.  Was Kim going to school?
Then he, an M A of Calcutta University, would explain the advantages of
education.  There were marks to be gained by due attention to Latin and
Wordsworth's Excursion (all this was Greek to Kim).  French, too was
vital, and the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles
from Calcutta.  Also a man might go far, as he himself had done, by
strict attention to plays called Lear and Julius Caesar, both much in
demand by examiners.  Lear was not so full of historical allusions as
Julius Caesar; the book cost four annas, but could be bought
second-hand in Bow Bazar for two.  Still more important than
Wordsworth, or the eminent authors, Burke and Hare, was the art and
science of mensuration.  A boy who had passed his examination in these
branches--for which, by the way, there were no cram-books--could, by
merely marching over a country with a compass and a level and a
straight eye, carry away a picture of that country which might be sold
for large sums in coined silver.  But as it was occasionally
inexpedient to carry about measuring-chains a boy would do well to know
the precise length of his own foot-pace, so that when he was deprived
of what Hurree Chunder called adventitious aids' he might still tread
his distances.  To keep count of thousands of paces, Hurree Chunder's
experience had shown him nothing more valuable than a rosary of
eighty-one or a hundred and eight beads, for 'it was divisible and
sub-divisible into many multiples and sub-multiples'.  Through the
volleying drifts of English, Kim caught the general trend of the talk,
and it interested him very much.  Here was a new craft that a man could
tuck away in his head and by the look of the large wide world unfolding
itself before him, it seemed that the more a man knew the better for
him.

Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half 'I hope some
day to enjoy your offeecial acquaintance.  Ad interim, if I may be
pardoned that expression, I shall give you this betel-box, which is
highly valuable article and cost me two rupees only four years ago.' It
was a cheap, heart-shaped brass thing with three compartments for
carrying the eternal betel-nut, lime and pan-leaf; but it was filled
with little tabloid-bottles.

'That is reward of merit for your performance in character of that holy
man.  You see, you are so young you think you will last for ever and
not take care of your body.  It is great nuisance to go sick in the
middle of business.  I am fond of drugs myself, and they are handy to
cure poor people too.  These are good Departmental drugs--quinine and
so on.  I give it you for souvenir.  Now good-bye.  I have urgent
private business here by the roadside.'

He slipped out noiselessly as a cat, on the Umballa road, hailed a
passing cart and jingled away, while Kim, tongue-tied, twiddled the
brass betel-box in his hands.

The record of a boy's education interests few save his parents, and, as
you know, Kim was an orphan.  It is written in the books of St Xavier's
in Partibus that a report of Kim's progress was forwarded at the end of
each term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor, from whose hands
duly came the money for his schooling.  It is further recorded in the
same books that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as
well as map-making, and carried away a prize (The Life of Lord
Lawrence, tree-calf, two vols., nine rupees, eight annas) for
proficiency therein; and the same term played in St Xavier's eleven
against the Alighur Mohammedan College, his age being fourteen years
and ten months.  He was also re-vaccinated (from which we may assume
that there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow) about the
same time.  Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster-roll record that
he was punished several times for 'conversing with improper persons',
and it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for 'absenting
himself for a day in the company of a street beggar'.  That was when he
got over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down
the banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays--for
one month--for a little week; and the lama set his face as a flint
against it, averring that the time had not yet come.  Kim's business,
said the old man as they ate cakes together, was to get all the wisdom
of the Sahibs and then he would see.  The Hand of Friendship must in
some way have averted the Whip of Calamity, for six weeks later Kim
seems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying 'with great
credit', his age being fifteen years and eight months.  From this date
the record is silent.  His name does not appear in the year's batch of
those who entered for the subordinate Survey of India, but against it
stand the words 'removed on appointment.'

Several times in those three years, cast up at the Temple of the
Tirthankars in Benares the lama, a little thinner and a shade yellower,
if that were possible, but gentle and untainted as ever. Sometimes it
was from the South that he came--from south of Tuticorin, whence the
wonderful fire-boats go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali;
sometimes it was from the wet green West and the thousand
cotton-factory chimneys that ring Bombay; and once from the North,
where he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with
the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House.  He would stride to his
cell in the cool, cut marble--the priests of the Temple were good to
the old man,--wash off the dust of travel, make prayer, and depart for
Lucknow, well accustomed now to the way of the rail, in a third-class
carriage.  Returning, it was noticeable, as his friend the Seeker
pointed out to the head-priest, that he ceased for a while to mourn the
loss of his River, or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life,
but preferred to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious
chela whom no man of the Temple had ever seen.  Yes, he had followed
the traces of the Blessed Feet throughout all India.  (The Curator has
still in his possession a most marvellous account of his wanderings and
meditations.) There remained nothing more in life but to find the River
of the Arrow. Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter
not to be undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had
with him the one chela appointed to bring the event to a happy issue,
and versed in great wisdom--such wisdom as white-haired Keepers of
Images possess.  For example (here came out the snuff-gourd, and the
kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent):

'Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares--let all listen
to the Tataka!--an elephant was captured for a time by the king's
hunters and ere he broke free, beringed with a grievous legiron.  This
he strove to remove with hate and frenzy in his heart, and hurrying up
and down the forests, besought his brother-elephants to wrench it
asunder.  One by one, with their strong trunks, they tried and failed.
At the last they gave it as their opinion that the ring was not to be
broken by any bestial power.  And in a thicket, new-born, wet with
moisture of birth, lay a day-old calf of the herd whose mother had
died.  The fettered elephant, forgetting his own agony, said:  "If I do
not help this suckling it will perish under our feet."  So he stood
above the young thing, making his legs buttresses against the uneasily
moving herd; and he begged milk of a virtuous cow, and the calf throve,
and the ringed elephant was the calf's guide and defence.  Now the days
of an elephant--let all listen to the Tataka!--are thirty-five years to
his full strength, and through thirty-five Rains the ringed elephant
befriended the younger, and all the while the fetter ate into the flesh.

'Then one day the young elephant saw the half-buried iron, and turning
to the elder said:  "What is this?"  "It is even my sorrow," said he
who had befriended him.  Then that other put out his trunk and in the
twinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring, saying:  "The appointed
time has come."  So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately
and done kind acts was relieved, at the appointed time, by the very
calf whom he had turned aside to cherish--let all listen to the Tataka!
for the Elephant was Ananda, and the Calf that broke the ring was none
other than The Lord Himself...'

Then he would shake his head benignly, and over the ever-clicking
rosary point out how free that elephant-calf was from the sin of pride.
He was as humble as a chela who, seeing his master sitting in the dust
outside the Gates of Learning, over-leapt the gates (though they were
locked) and took his master to his heart in the presence of the
proud-stomached city.  Rich would be the reward of such a master and
such a chela when the time came for them to seek freedom together!

So did the lama speak, coming and going across India as softly as a
bat.  A sharp-tongued old woman in a house among the fruit-trees behind
Saharunpore honoured him as the woman honoured the prophet, but his
chamber was by no means upon the wall.  In an apartment of the
forecourt overlooked by cooing doves he would sit, while she laid aside
her useless veil and chattered of spirits and fiends of Kulu, of
grandchildren unborn, and of the free-tongued brat who had talked to
her in the resting-place.  Once, too, he strayed alone from the Grand
Trunk Road below Umballa to the very village whose priest had tried to
drug him; but the kind Heaven that guards lamas sent him at twilight
through the crops, absorbed and unsuspicious, to the Rissaldar's door.
Here was like to have been a grave misunderstanding, for the old
soldier asked him why the Friend of the Stars had gone that way only
six days before.

'That may not be,' said the lama.  'He has gone back to his own people.'

'He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago,'
his host insisted.  'True, he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn
after foolish talk with my granddaughter.  He grows apace, but he is
the same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war.  Have
ye parted?'

'Yes--and no,' the lama replied.  'We--we have not altogether parted,
but the time is not ripe that we should take the Road together.  He
acquires wisdom in another place.  We must wait.'

'All one--but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so
continually of thee?'

'And what said he?'  asked the lama eagerly.

'Sweet words--an hundred thousand--that thou art his father and mother
and such all.  Pity that he does not take the Qpeen's service. He is
fearless.'

This news amazed the lama, who did not then know how religiously Kim
kept to the contract made with Mahbub Ali, and perforce ratified by
Colonel Creighton...

'There is no holding the young pony from the game,' said the
horse-dealer when the Colonel pointed out that vagabonding over India
in holiday time was absurd.  'If permission be refused to go and come
as he chooses, he will make light of the refusal.  Then who is to catch
him?  Colonel Sahib, only once in a thousand years is a horse born so
well fitted for the game as this our colt.  And we need men.'




Chapter 10


  Your tiercel's too long at hack, Sire.  He's no eyass
  But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him,
  Dangerously free o' the air.  Faith!  were he mine
  (As mine's the glove he binds to for his tirings)
  I'd fly him with a make-hawk.  He's in yarak
  Plumed to the very point--so manned, so weathered...
  Give him the firmament God made him for,
  And what shall take the air of him?

  Gow's Watch


Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech, but his advice tallied with
Mahbub's; and the upshot was good for Kim.  He knew better now than to
leave Lucknow city in native garb, and if Mahbub were anywhere within
reach of a letter, it was to Mahbub's camp he headed, and made his
change under the Pathan's wary eye.  Could the little Survey paint-box
that he used for map-tinting in term-time have found a tongue to tell
of holiday doings, he might have been expelled.  Once Mahbub and he
went together as far as the beautiful city of Bombay, with three
truckloads of tram-horses, and Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a
sail in a dhow across the Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs, which, he
understood from a hanger-on of the dealer Abdul Rahman, fetched better
prices than mere Kabulis.

He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and
a few co-religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner.  They came back
by way of Karachi by sea, when Kim took his first experience of
sea-sickness sitting on the fore-hatch of a coasting-steamer, well
persuaded he had been poisoned.  The Babu's famous drug-box proved
useless, though Kim had restocked it at Bombay. Mahbub had business at
Quetta, and there Kim, as Mahbub admitted, earned his keep, and perhaps
a little over, by spending four curious days as scullion in the house
of a fat Commissariat sergeant, from whose office-box, in an auspicious
moment, he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied out--it
seemed to deal entirely with cattle and camel sales--by moonlight,
lying behind an outhouse, all through one hot night.  Then he returned
the ledger to its place, and, at Mahbub's word, left that service
unpaid, rejoining him six miles down the road, the clean copy in his
bosom.

'That soldier is a small fish,' Mahbub Ali explained, 'but in time we
shall catch the larger one.  He only sells oxen at two prices--one for
himself and one for the Government--which I do not think is a sin.'

'Why could not I take away the little book and be done with it?'

'Then he would have been frightened, and he would have told his master.
Then we should miss, perhaps, a great number of new rifles which seek
their way up from Quetta to the North.  The Game is so large that one
sees but a little at a time.'

'Oho!'  said Kim, and held his tongue.  That was in the monsoon
holidays, after he had taken the prize for mathematics.  The Christmas
holidays he spent--deducting ten days for private amusements--with
Lurgan Sahib, where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring
wood-fire--Jakko road was four feet deep in snow that year--and--the
small Hindu had gone away to be married--helped Lurgan to thread
pearls.  He made Kim learn whole chapters of the Koran by heart, till
he could deliver them with the very roll and cadence of a mullah.
Moreover, he told Kim the names and properties of many native drugs, as
well as the runes proper to recite when you administer them.  And in
the evenings he wrote charms on parchment--elaborate pentagrams crowned
with the names of devils--Murra, and Awan the Companion of Kings--all
fantastically written in the corners.  More to the point, he advised
Kim as to the care of his own body, the cure of fever-fits, and simple
remedies of the Road.  A week before it was time to go down, Colonel
Creighton Sahib--this was unfair--sent Kim a written examination paper
that concerned itself solely with rods and chains and links and angles.

Next holidays he was out with Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly
died of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious
city of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined
throughout with camel-bone.  It was not an amusing trip from Kim's
point of view, because--in defiance of the contract--the Colonel
ordered him to make a map of that wild, walled city; and since
Mohammedan horse-boys and pipe-tenders are not expected to drag
Survey-chains round the capital of an independent Native State, Kim was
forced to pace all his distances by means of a bead rosary. He used the
compass for bearings as occasion served--after dark chiefly, when the
camels had been fed--and by the help of his little Survey paint-box of
six colour-cakes and three brushes, he achieved something not remotely
unlike the city of Jeysulmir.  Mahbub laughed a great deal, and advised
him to make up a written report as well; and in the back of the big
account-book that lay under the flap of Mahbub's pet saddle Kim fell to
work..

'It must hold everything that thou hast seen or touched or considered.
Write as though the Jung-i-Lat Sahib himself had come by stealth with a
vast army outsetting to war.'

'How great an army?'

'Oh, half a lakh of men.'

'Folly!  Remember how few and bad were the wells in the sand.  Not a
thousand thirsty men could come near by here.'

'Then write that down--also all the old breaches in the walls and
whence the firewood is cut--and what is the temper and disposition of
the King.  I stay here till all my horses are sold.  I will hire a room
by the gateway, and thou shalt be my accountant.  There is a good lock
to the door.'

The report in its unmistakable St Xavier's running script, and the
brown, yellow, and lake-daubed map, was on hand a few years ago (a
careless clerk filed it with the rough notes of E's second Seistan
survey), but by now the pencil characters must be almost illegible. Kim
translated it, sweating under the light of an oil-lamp, to Mahbub, the
second day of their return-journey.

The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle-bags.

'I knew it would be worthy a dress of honour, and so I made one ready,'
he said, smiling.  'Were I Amir of Afghanistan (and some day we may see
him), I would fill thy mouth with gold.'  He laid the garments formally
at Kim's feet.  There was a gold-embroidered Peshawur turban-cap,
rising to a cone, and a big turban-cloth ending in a broad fringe of
gold.  There was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky
white shirt, fastening to the right, ample and flowing; green pyjamas
with twisted silk waist-string; and that nothing might be lacking,
russia-leather slippers, smelling divinely, with arrogantly curled tips.

'Upon a Wednesday, and in the morning, to put on new clothes is
auspicious,' said Mahbub solemnly.  'But we must not forget the wicked
folk in the world.  So!'

He capped all the splendour, that was taking Kim's delighted breath
away, with a mother-of-pearl, nickel-plated, self-extracting .450
revolver.

'I had thought of a smaller bore, but reflected that this takes
Government bullets.  A man can always come by those--especially across
the Border.  Stand up and let me look.'  He clapped Kim on the
shoulder.  'May you never be tired, Pathan!  Oh, the hearts to be
broken!  Oh, the eyes under the eyelashes, looking sideways!'

Kim turned about, pointed his toes, stretched, and felt mechanically
for the moustache that was just beginning.  Then he stooped towards
Mahbub's feet to make proper acknowledgment with fluttering,
quick-patting hands; his heart too full for words.  Mahbub forestalled
and embraced him.

'My son, said he, 'what need of words between us?  But is not the
little gun a delight?  All six cartridges come out at one twist.  It is
borne in the bosom next the skin, which, as it were, keeps it oiled.
Never put it elsewhere, and please God, thou shalt some day kill a man
with it.'

'Hai mai!'  said Kim ruefully.  'If a Sahib kills a man he is hanged in
the jail.'

'True:  but one pace beyond the Border, men are wiser.  Put it away;
but fill it first.  Of what use is a gun unfed?'


'When I go back to the madrissah I must return it.  They do not allow
little guns.  Thou wilt keep it for me?'


'Son, I am wearied of that madrissah, where they take the best years of
a man to teach him what he can only learn upon the Road.  The folly of
the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom.  No matter.  Maybe thy written
report shall save thee further bondage; and God He knows we need men
more and more in the Game.'

They marched, jaw-bound against blowing sand, across the salt desert to
Jodhpur, where Mahbub and his handsome nephew Habib Ullah did much
trading; and then sorrowfully, in European clothes, which he was fast
outgrowing, Kim went second-class to St Xavier's.  Three weeks later,
Colonel Creighton, pricing Tibetan ghost-daggers at Lurgan's shop,
faced Mahbub Ali openly mutinous.  Lurgan Sahib operated as support in
reserve.

'The pony is made--finished--mouthed and paced, Sahib!  From now on,
day by day, he will lose his manners if he is kept at tricks. Drop the
rein on his back and let go,' said the horse-dealer.  'We need him.'

'But he is so young, Mahbub--not more than sixteen--is he?'

'When I was fifteen, I had shot my man and begot my man, Sahib.'

'You impenitent old heathen!'  Creighton turned to Lurgan.  The black
beard nodded assent to the wisdom of the Afghan's dyed scarlet.

'I should have used him long ago,' said Lurgan.  'The younger the
better.  That is why I always have my really valuable jewels watched by
a child.  You sent him to me to try.  I tried him in every way:  he is
the only boy I could not make to see things.'

'In the crystal--in the ink-pool?'  demanded Mahbub.

'No.  Under my hand, as I told you.  That has never happened before. It
means that he is strong enough--but you think it skittles, Colonel
Creighton--to make anyone do anything he wants.  And that is three
years ago.  I have taught him a good deal since, Colonel Creighton.  I
think you waste him now.'

'Hmm!  Maybe you're right.  But, as you know, there is no Survey work
for him at present.'

'Let him out let him go,' Mahbub interrupted.  'Who expects any colt to
carry heavy weight at first?  Let him run with the caravans--like our
white camel-colts--for luck.  I would take him myself, but--'

'There is a little business where he would be most useful--in the
South,' said Lurgan, with peculiar suavity, dropping his heavy blued
eyelids.

'E.23 has that in hand,' said Creighton quickly.  'He must not go down
there.  Besides, he knows no Turki.'

'Only tell him the shape and the smell of the letters we want and he
will bring them back,' Lurgan insisted.

'No.  That is a man's job,' said Creighton.

It was a wry-necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary
correspondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate
authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the
world, and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to
book for kidnapping women within British territory.  The Moslem
Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was
merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no
need he should continue a correspondence which might some day
compromise him.  One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder
was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as
E.23, taking up the work, duly reported.

These facts, and a few others not to be published, made both Mahbub and
Creighton shake their heads.

'Let him go out with his Red Lama,' said the horse-dealer with visible
effort.  'He is fond of the old man.  He can learn his paces by the
rosary at least.'

'I have had some dealings with the old man--by letter,' said Colonel
Creighton, smiling to himself.  'Whither goes he?'

'Up and down the land, as he has these three years.  He seeks a River
of Healing.  God's curse upon all--' Mahbub checked himself.  'He beds
down at the Temple of the Tirthankars or at Buddh Gaya when he is in
from the Road.  Then he goes to see the boy at the madrissah, as we
know for the boy was punished for it twice or thrice.  He is quite mad,
but a peaceful man.  I have met him.  The Babu also has had dealings
with him.  We have watched him for three years.  Red Lamas are not so
common in Hind that one loses track.'

'Babus are very curious,' said Lurgan meditatively.  'Do you know what
Hurree Babu really wants?  He wants to be made a member of the Royal
Society by taking ethnological notes.  I tell you, I tell him about the
lama everything which Mahbub and the boy have told me. Hurree Babu goes
down to Benares--at his own expense, I think.'

'I don't,' said Creighton briefly.  He had paid Hurree's travelling
expenses, out of a most lively curiosity to learn what the lama might
be.

'And he applies to the lama for information on lamaism, and
devil-dances, and spells and charms, several times in these few years.
Holy Virgin!  I could have told him all that yeears ago.  I think
Hurree Babu is getting too old for the Road.  He likes better to
collect manners and customs information.  Yes, he wants to be an FRS.

'Hurree thinks well of the boy, doesn't he?'

'Oh, very indeed--we have had some pleasant evenings at my little
place--but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on
the Ethnological side.'

'Not for a first experience.  How does that strike you, Mahbub?  Let
the boy run with the lama for six months.  After that we can see.  He
will get experience.'

'He has it already, Sahib--as a fish controls the water he swims in.
But for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school.'

'Very good, then,' said Creighton, half to himself.  'He can go with
the lama, and if Hurree Babu cares to keep an eye on them so much the
better.  He won't lead the boy into any danger as Mahbub would.
Curious--his wish to be an F R S. Very human, too.  He is best on the
Ethnological side--Hurree.'

No money and no preferment would have drawn Creighton from his work on
the Indian Survey, but deep in his heart also lay the ambition to write
'F R S' after his name.  Honours of a sort he knew could be obtained by
ingenuity and the help of friends, but, to the best of his belief,
nothing save work--papers representing a life of it--took a man into
the Society which he had bombarded for years with monographs on strange
Asiatic cults and unknown customs.  Nine men out of ten would flee from
a Royal Society soiree in extremity of boredom; but Creighton was the
tenth, and at times his soul yearned for the crowded rooms in easy
London where silver-haired, bald-headed gentlemen who know nothing of
the Army move among spectroscopic experiments, the lesser plants of the
frozen tundras, electric flight-measuring machines, and apparatus for
slicing into fractional millimetres the left eye of the female
mosquito.  By all right and reason, it was the Royal Geographical that
should have appealed to him, but men are as chancy as children in their
choice of playthings.  So Creighton smiled, and thought the better of
Hurree Babu, moved by like desire.

He dropped the ghost-dagger and looked up at Mahbub.

'How soon can we get the colt from the stable?'  said the horse-dealer,
reading his eyes.

'Hmm!  If I withdraw him by order now--what will he do, think you?  I
have never before assisted at the teaching of such an one.'

'He will come to me,' said Mahbub promptly.  'Lurgan Sahib and I will
prepare him for the Road.'

'So be it, then.  For six months he shall run at his choice.  But who
will be his sponsor?'

Lurgan slightly inclined his head.  'He will not tell anything, if that
is what you are afraid of, Colonel Creighton.'

'It's only a boy, after all.'

'Ye-es; but first, he has nothing to tell; and secondly, he knows what
would happen.  Also, he is very fond of Mahbub, and of me a little.'

'Will he draw pay?'  demanded the practical horse-dealer.

'Food and water allowance only.  Twenty rupees a month.'

One advantage of the Secret Service is that it has no worrying audit.
That Service is ludicrously starved, of course, but the funds are
administered by a few men who do not call for vouchers or present
itemized accounts.  Mahbub's eyes lighted with almost a Sikh's love of
money.  Even Lurgan's impassive face changed.  He considered the years
to come when Kim would have been entered and made to the Great Game
that never ceases day and night, throughout India.  He foresaw honour
and credit in the mouths of a chosen few, coming to him from his pupil.
Lurgan Sahib had made E.23 what E.23 was, out of a bewildered,
impertinent, lying, little North-West Province man.

But the joy of these masters was pale and smoky beside the joy of Kim
when St Xavier's Head called him aside, with word that Colonel
Creighton had sent for him.

'I understand, O'Hara, that he has found you a place as an assistant
chain-man in the Canal Department:  that comes of taking up
mathematics.  It is great luck for you, for you are only sixteen; but
of course you understand that you do not become pukka [permanent] till
you have passed the autumn examination.  So you must not think you are
going out into the world to enjoy yourself, or that your fortune is
made.  There is a great deal of hard work before you. Only, if you
succeed in becoming pukka, you can rise, you know, to four hundred and
fifty a month.'  Whereat the Principal gave him much good advice as to
his conduct, and his manners, and his morals; and others, his elders,
who had not been wafted into billets, talked as only Anglo-Indian lads
can, of favouritism and corruption.  Indeed, young Cazalet, whose
father was a pensioner at Chunar, hinted very broadly that Colonel
Creighton's interest in Kim was directly paternal; and Kim, instead of
retaliating, did not even use language.  He was thinking of the immense
fun to come, of Mahbub's letter of the day before, all neatly written
in English, making appointment for that afternoon in a house the very
name of which would have crisped the Principal's hair with horror...

Said Kim to Mahbub in Lucknow railway station that evening, above the
luggage-scales:  'I feared lest at the last, the roof would fall upon
me and cheat me.  It is indeed all finished, O my father?'

Mahbub snapped his fingers to show the utterness of that end, and his
eyes blazed like red coals.

'Then where is the pistol that I may wear it?'

'Softly!  A half-year, to run without heel-ropes.  I begged that much
from Colonel Creighton Sahib.  At twenty rupees a month.  Old Red Hat
knows that thou art coming.'

'I will pay thee dustoorie [commission] on my pay for three months,'
said Kim gravely.  'Yea, two rupees a month.  But first we must get rid
of these.'  He plucked his thin linen trousers and dragged at his
collar.  'I have brought with me all that I need on the Road.  My trunk
has gone up to Lurgan Sahib's.'

'Who sends his salaams to thee--Sahib.'

'Lurgan Sahib is a very clever man.  But what dost thou do?'

'I go North again, upon the Great Game.  What else?  Is thy mind still
set on following old Red Hat?'

'Do not forget he made me that I am--though he did not know it. Year by
year, he sent the money that taught me.'

'I would have done as much--had it struck my thick head,' Mahbub
growled.  'Come away.  The lamps are lit now, and none will mark thee
in the bazar.  We go to Huneefa's house.'

On the way thither, Mahbub gave him much the same sort of advice as his
mother gave to Lemuel, and curiously enough, Mahbub was exact to point
out how Huneefa and her likes destroyed kings.

'And I remember,' he quoted maliciously, 'one who said, "Trust a snake
before an harlot, and an harlot before a Pathan, Mahbub Ali." Now,
excepting as to Pathans, of whom I am one, all that is true. Most true
is it in the Great Game, for it is by means of women that all plans
come to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut.  So it
happened to such a one.'  He gave the reddest particulars.

'Then why--?'  Kim paused before a filthy staircase that climbed to the
warm darkness of an upper chamber, in the ward that is behind Azim
Ullah's tobacco-shop.  Those who know it call it The Birdcage--it is so
full of whisperings and whistlings and chirrupings.

The room, with its dirty cushions and half-smoked hookahs, smelt
abominably of stale tobacco.  In one corner lay a huge and shapeless
woman clad in greenish gauzes, and decked, brow, nose, ear, neck,
wrist, arm, waist, and ankle with heavy native jewellery.  When she
turned it was like the clashing of copper pots.  A lean cat in the
balcony outside the window mewed hungrily.  Kim checked, bewildered, at
the door-curtain.

'Is that the new stuff, Mahbub?'  said Huneefa lazily, scarce troubling
to remove the mouthpiece from her lips.  'O Buktanoos!'--like most of
her kind, she swore by the Djinns--'O Buktanoos!  He is very good to
look upon.'

'That is part of the selling of the horse,' Mahbub explained to Kim,
who laughed.

'I have heard that talk since my Sixth Day,' he replied, squatting by
the light.  'Whither does it lead?'

'To protection.  Tonight we change thy colour.  This sleeping under
roofs has blanched thee like an almond.  But Huneefa has the secret of
a colour that catches.  No painting of a day or two.  Also, we fortify
thee against the chances of the Road.  That is my gift to thee, my son.
Take out all metals on thee and lay them here.  Make ready, Huneefa.'

Kim dragged forth his compass, Survey paint-box, and the new-filled
medicine-box.  They had all accompanied his travels, and boylike he
valued them immensely.

The woman rose slowly and moved with her hands a little spread before
her.  Then Kim saw that she was blind.  'No, no,' she muttered, 'the
Pathan speaks truth--my colour does not go in a week or a month, and
those whom I protect are under strong guard.'

'When one is far off and alone, it would not be well to grow blotched
and leprous of a sudden,' said Mahbub.  'When thou wast with me I could
oversee the matter.  Besides, a Pathan is a fair-skin. Strip to the
waist now and look how thou art whitened.'  Huneefa felt her way back
from an inner room.  'It is no matter, she cannot see.' He took a
pewter bowl from her ringed hand.

The dye-stuff showed blue and gummy.  Kim experimented on the back of
his wrist, with a dab of cotton-wool; but Huneefa heard him.

'No, no,' she cried, 'the thing is not done thus, but with the proper
ceremonies.  The colouring is the least part.  I give thee the full
protection of the Road.'

'Tadoo?  [magic],'said Kim, with a half start.  He did not like the
white, sightless eyes.  Mahbub's hand on his neck bowed him to the
floor, nose within an inch of the boards.

'Be still.  No harm comes to thee, my son.  I am thy sacrifice!'

He could not see what the woman was about, but heard the dish-clash of
her jewellery for many minutes.  A match lit up the darkness; he caught
the well-known purr and fizzle of grains of incense.  Then the room
filled with smoke--heavy aromatic, and stupefying.  Through growing
drowse he heard the names of devils--of Zulbazan, Son of Eblis, who
lives in bazars and paraos, making all the sudden lewd wickedness of
wayside halts; of Dulhan, invisible about mosques, the dweller among
the slippers of the faithful, who hinders folk from their prayers; and
Musboot, Lord of lies and panic.  Huneefa, now whispering in his ear,
now talking as from an immense distance, touched him with horrible soft
fingers, but Mahbub's grip never shifted from his neck till, relaxing
with a sigh, the boy lost his senses.

'Allah!  How he fought!  We should never have done it but for the
drugs.  That was his white blood, I take it,' said Mahbub testily. 'Go
on with the dawut [invocation].  Give him full Protection.'

'O Hearer!  Thou that hearest with ears, be present.  Listen, O
Hearer!'  Huneefa moaned, her dead eyes turned to the west.  The dark
room filled with moanings and snortings.

From the outer balcony, a ponderous figure raised a round bullet head
and coughed nervously.

'Do not interrupt this ventriloquial necromanciss, my friend,' it said
in English.  'I opine that it is very disturbing to you, but no
enlightened observer is jolly-well upset.'

'..........I will lay a plot for their ruin!  O Prophet, bear with the
unbelievers.  Let them alone awhile!'  Huneefa's face, turned to the
northward, worked horribly, and it was as though voices from the
ceiling answered her.

Hurree Babu returned to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill, but
his hand shook.  Huneefa, in some sort of drugged ecstasy, wrenched
herself to and fro as she sat cross-legged by Kim's still head, and
called upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual,
binding them to avoid the boy's every action.

'With Him are the keys of the Secret Things!  None knoweth them besides
Himself He knoweth that which is in the dry land and in the sea!'
Again broke out the unearthly whistling responses.

'I--I apprehend it is not at all malignant in its operation?'  said the
Babu, watching the throat-muscles quiver and jerk as Huneefa spoke with
tongues.  'It--it is not likely that she has killed the boy?  If so, I
decline to be witness at the trial .....What was the last hypothetical
devil mentioned?'

'Babuji,' said Mahbub in the vernacular.  'I have no regard for the
devils of Hind, but the Sons of Eblis are far otherwise, and whether
they be jumalee [well-affected] or jullalee [terrible] they love not
Kafirs.'

'Then you think I had better go?'  said Hurree Babu, half rising. 'They
are, of course, dematerialized phenomena.  Spencer says.'

Huneefa's crisis passed, as these things must, in a paroxysm of
howling, with a touch of froth at the lips.  She lay spent and
motionless beside Kim, and the crazy voices ceased.

'Wah!  That work is done.  May the boy be better for it; and Huneefa is
surely a mistress of dawut.  Help haul her aside, Babu.  Do not be
afraid.'

'How am I to fear the absolutely non-existent?'  said Hurree Babu,
talking English to reassure himself.  It is an awful thing still to
dread the magic that you contemptuously investigate--to collect
folk-lore for the Royal Society with a lively belief in all Powers of
Darkness.

Mahbub chuckled.  He had been out with Hurree on the Road ere now. 'Let
us finish the colouring,' said he.  'The boy is well protected if--if
the Lords of the Air have ears to hear.  I am a Sufi [free-thinker],
but when one can get blind-sides of a woman, a stallion, or a devil,
why go round to invite a kick?  Set him upon the way, Babu, and see
that old Red Hat does not lead him beyond our reach.  I must get back
to my horses.'

'All raight,' said Hurree Babu.  'He is at present curious spectacle.'

About third cockcrow, Kim woke after a sleep of thousands of years.
Huneefa, in her corner, snored heavily, but Mahbub was gone.

'I hope you were not frightened,' said an oily voice at his elbow. 'I
superintended entire operation, which was most interesting from
ethnological point of view.  It was high-class dawut.'

'Huh!'  said Kim, recognizing Hurree Babu, who smiled ingratiatingly.

'And also I had honour to bring down from Lurgan your present costume.
I am not in the habit offeecially of carrying such gauds to
subordinates, but'--he giggled--'your case is noted as exceptional on
the books.  I hope Mr Lurgan will note my action.'

Kim yawned and stretched himself.  It was good to turn and twist within
loose clothes once again.

'What is this?'  He looked curiously at the heavy duffle-stuff loaded
with the scents of the far North.

'Oho!  That is inconspicuous dress of chela attached to service of
lamaistic lama.  Complete in every particular,' said Hurree Babu,
rolling into the balcony to clean his teeth at a goglet.  'I am of
opeenion it is not your old gentleman's precise releegion, but rather
sub-variant of same.  I have contributed rejected notes To Whom It May
Concern:  Asiatic Quarterly Review on these subjects.  Now it is
curious that the old gentleman himself is totally devoid of
releegiosity.  He is not a dam' particular.'

'Do you know him?'

Hurree Babu held up his hand to show he was engaged in the prescribed
rites that accompany tooth-cleaning and such things among decently bred
Bengalis.  Then he recited in English an Arya-Somaj prayer of a
theistical nature, and stuffed his mouth with pan and betel.

'Oah yes.  I have met him several times at Benares, and also at Buddh
Gaya, to interrogate him on releegious points and devil-worship.  He is
pure agnostic--same as me.'

Huneefa stirred in her sleep, and Hurree Babu jumped nervously to the
copper incense-burner, all black and discoloured in morning-light,
rubbed a finger in the accumulated lamp-black, and drew it diagonally
across his face.

'Who has died in thy house?'  asked Kim in the vernacular.

'None.  But she may have the Evil Eye--that sorceress,' the Babu
replied.

'What dost thou do now, then?'

'I will set thee on thy way to Benares, if thou goest thither, and tell
thee what must be known by Us.'

'I go.  At what hour runs the te-rain?'  He rose to his feet, looked
round the desolate chamber and at the yellow-wax face of Huneefa as the
low sun stole across the floor.  'Is there money to be paid that witch?'

'No.  She has charmed thee against all devils and all dangers in the
name of her devils.  It was Mahbub's desire.'  In English:  'He is
highly obsolete, I think, to indulge in such supersteetion.  Why, it is
all ventriloquy.  Belly-speak--eh?'

Kim snapped his fingers mechanically to avert whatever evil--Mahbub, he
knew, meditated none--might have crept in through Huneefa's
ministrations; and Hurree giggled once more.  But as he crossed the
room he was careful not to step in Huneefa's blotched, squat shadow on
the boards.  Witches--when their time is on them--can lay hold of the
heels of a man's soul if he does that.

'Now you must well listen,' said the Babu when they were in the fresh
air.  'Part of these ceremonies which we witnessed they include supply
of effeecient amulet to those of our Department.  If you feel in your
neck you will find one small silver amulet, verree cheap. That is ours.
Do you understand?'

'Oah yes, hawa-dilli [a heart-lifter],' said Kim, feeling at his neck.

'Huneefa she makes them for two rupees twelve annas with--oh, all sorts
of exorcisms.  They are quite common, except they are partially black
enamel, and there is a paper inside each one full of names of local
saints and such things.  Thatt is Huneefa's look-out, you see? Huneefa
makes them onlee for us, but in case she does not, when we get them we
put in, before issue, one small piece of turquoise.  Mr Lurgan he gives
them.  There is no other source of supply; but it was me invented all
this.  It is strictly unoffeecial of course, but convenient for
subordinates.  Colonel Creighton he does not know.  He is European.
The turquoise is wrapped in the paper ...  Yes, that is road to railway
station ...  Now suppose you go with the lama, or with me, I hope, some
day, or with Mahbub.  Suppose we get into a dam'-tight place.  I am a
fearful man--most fearful--but I tell you I have been in dam'-tight
places more than hairs on my head.  You say:  "I am Son of the Charm."
Verree good.'

'I do not understand quite.  We must not be heard talking English here.'

'That is all raight.  I am only Babu showing off my English to you. All
we Babus talk English to show off;' said Hurree, flinging his
shoulder-cloth jauntily.  'As I was about to say, "Son of the Charm"
means that you may be member of the Sat Bhai--the Seven Brothers, which
is Hindi and Tantric.  It is popularly supposed to be extinct Society,
but I have written notes to show it is still extant.  You see, it is
all my invention.  Verree good.  Sat Bhai has many members, and perhaps
before they jolly-well-cut-your-throat they may give you just a chance
of life.  That is useful, anyhow.  And moreover, these foolish
natives--if they are not too excited--they always stop to think before
they kill a man who says he belongs to any speecific organization.  You
see?  You say then when you are in tight place, "I am Son of the
Charm", and you get--perhaps--ah--your second wind. That is only in
extreme instances, or to open negotiations with a stranger.  Can you
quite see?  Verree good.  But suppose now, I, or any one of the
Department, come to you dressed quite different.  You would not know me
at all unless I choose, I bet you.  Some day I will prove it.  I come
as Ladakhi trader--oh, anything--and I say to you:  "You want to buy
precious stones?"  You say:  "Do I look like a man who buys precious
stones?"  Then I say:  "Even verree poor man can buy a turquoise or
tarkeean."'

'That is kichree--vegetable curry,' said Kim.

'Of course it is.  You say:  "Let me see the tarkeean."  Then I say:
"It was cooked by a woman, and perhaps it is bad for your caste." Then
you say:  "There is no caste when men go to--look for tarkeean."  You
stop a little between those words, "to--look".  That is thee whole
secret.  The little stop before the words.'

Kim repeated the test-sentence.

'That is all right.  Then I will show you my turquoise if there is
time, and then you know who I am, and then we exchange views and
documents and those-all things.  And so it is with any other man of us.
We talk sometimes about turquoises and sometimes about tarkeean, but
always with that little stop in the words.  It is verree easy. First,
"Son of the Charm", if you are in a tight place.  Perhaps that may help
you--perhaps not.  Then what I have told you about the tarkeean, if you
want to transact offeecial business with a strange man.  Of course, at
present, you have no offeecial business.  You are--ah
ha!--supernumerary on probation.  Quite unique specimen.  If you were
Asiatic of birth you might be employed right off; but this half-year of
leave is to make you de-Englishized, you see?  The lama he expects you,
because I have demi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your
examinations, and will soon obtain Government appointment.  Oh ho!  You
are on acting-allowance, you see:  so if you are called upon to help
Sons of the Charm mind you jolly-well try. Now I shall say good-bye, my
dear fellow, and I hope you--ah--will come out top-side all raight.'

Hurree Babu stepped back a pace or two into the crowd at the entrance
of Lucknow station and--was gone.  Kim drew a deep breath and hugged
himself all over.  The nickel-plated revolver he could feel in the
bosom of his sad-coloured robe, the amulet was on his neck;
begging-gourd, rosary, and ghost-dagger (Mr Lurgan had forgotten
nothing) were all to hand, with medicine, paint-box, and compass, and
in a worn old purse-belt embroidered with porcupine-quill patterns lay
a month's pay.  Kings could be no richer.  He bought sweetmeats in a
leaf-cup from a Hindu trader, and ate them with glad rapture till a
policeman ordered him off the steps.




Chapter 11


  Give the man who is not made
  To his trade
  Swords to fling and catch again,
  Coins to ring and snatch again,
  Men to harm and cure again,
  Snakes to charm and lure again--
  He'll be hurt by his own blade,
  By his serpents disobeyed,
  By his clumsiness bewrayed,'
  By the people mocked to scorn--
  So 'tis not with juggler born!
  Pinch of dust or withered flower,
  Chance-flung fruit or borrowed staff,
  Serve his need and shore his power,
  Bind the spell, or loose the laugh!
  But a man who, etc.

  The Juggler's Song, op. 15


Followed a sudden natural reaction.

'Now am I alone--all alone,' he thought.  'In all India is no one so
alone as I! If I die today, who shall bring the news--and to whom? If I
live and God is good, there will be a price upon my head, for I am a
Son of the Charm--I, Kim.'

A very few white people, but many Asiatics, can throw themselves into a
mazement as it were by repeating their own names over and over again to
themselves, letting the mind go free upon speculation as to what is
called personal identity.  When one grows older, the power, usually,
departs, but while it lasts it may descend upon a man at any moment.

'Who is Kim--Kim--Kim?'

He squatted in a corner of the clanging waiting-room, rapt from all
other thoughts; hands folded in lap, and pupils contracted to
pin-points.  In a minute--in another half-second--he felt he would
arrive at the solution of the tremendous puzzle; but here, as always
happens, his mind dropped away from those heights with a rush of a
wounded bird, and passing his hand before his eyes, he shook his head.

A long-haired Hindu bairagi [holy man], who had just bought a ticket,
halted before him at that moment and stared intently.

'I also have lost it,' he said sadly.  'It is one of the Gates to the
Way, but for me it has been shut many years.'

'What is the talk?'  said Kim, abashed.

'Thou wast wondering there in thy spirit what manner of thing thy soul
might be.  The seizure came of a sudden.  I know.  Who should know but
I? Whither goest thou?'

'Toward Kashi [Benares].'

'There are no Gods there.  I have proved them.  I go to Prayag
[Allahabad] for the fifth time--seeking the Road to Enlightenment. Of
what faith art thou?'

'I too am a Seeker,' said Kim, using one of the lama's pet words.
'Though'--he forgot his Northern dress for the moment--'though Allah
alone knoweth what I seek.'

The old fellow slipped the bairagi's crutch under his armpit and sat
down on a patch of ruddy leopard's skin as Kim rose at the call for the
Benares train.

'Go in hope, little brother,' he said.  'It is a long road to the feet
of the One; but thither do we all travel.'

Kim did not feel so lonely after this, and ere he had sat out twenty
miles in the crowded compartment, was cheering his neighbours with a
string of most wonderful yarns about his own and his master's magical
gifts.

Benares struck him as a peculiarly filthy city, though it was pleasant
to find how his cloth was respected.  At least one-third of the
population prays eternally to some group or other of the many million
deities, and so reveres every sort of holy man.  Kim was guided to the
Temple of the Tirthankars, about a mile outside the city, near Sarnath,
by a chance-met Punjabi farmer--a Kamboh from Jullundur-way who had
appealed in vain to every God of his homestead to cure his small son,
and was trying Benares as a last resort.

'Thou art from the North?'  he asked, shouldering through the press of
the narrow, stinking streets much like his own pet bull at home.

'Ay, I know the Punjab.  My mother was a pahareen, but my father came
from Amritzar--by Jandiala,' said Kim, oiling his ready tongue for the
needs of the Road.

'Jandiala--Jullundur?  Oho!  Then we be neighbours in some sort, as it
were.'  He nodded tenderly to the wailing child in his arms.  'Whom
dost thou serve?'

'A most holy man at the Temple of the Tirthankers.'

'They are all most holy and--most greedy,' said the Jat with
bitterness.  'I have walked the pillars and trodden the temples till my
feet are flayed, and the child is no whit better.  And the mother being
sick too ...  Hush, then, little one ...  We changed his name when the
fever came.  We put him into girl's clothes.  There was nothing we did
not do, except--I said to his mother when she bundled me off to
Benares--she should have come with me--I said Sakhi Sarwar Sultan would
serve us best.  We know His generosity, but these down-country Gods are
strangers.'

The child turned on the cushion of the huge corded arms and looked at
Kim through heavy eyelids.

'And was it all worthless?'  Kim asked, with easy interest.

'All worthless--all worthless,' said the child, lips cracking with
fever.

'The Gods have given him a good mind, at least' said the father
proudly.  'To think he should have listened so cleverly.  Yonder is thy
Temple.  Now I am a poor man--many priests have dealt with me--but my
son is my son, and if a gift to thy master can cure him--I am at my
very wits' end.'

Kim considered for a while, tingling with pride.  Three years ago he
would have made prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without
a thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he
was a man.  Moreover, he had tasted fever once or twice already, and
knew enough to recognize starvation when he saw it.

'Call him forth and I will give him a bond on my best yoke, so that the
child is cured.'

Kim halted at the carved outer door of the temple.  A white-clad Oswal
banker from Ajmir, his sins of usury new wiped out, asked him what he
did.

'I am chela to Teshoo Lama, an Holy One from Bhotiyal--within there. He
bade me come.  I wait.  Tell him.'

'Do not forget the child,' cried the importunate Jat over his shoulder,
and then bellowed in Punjabi; 'O Holy One--O disciple of the Holy
One--O Gods above all the Worlds--behold affliction sitting at the
gate!'  That cry is so common in Benares that the passers never turned
their heads.

The Oswal, at peace with mankind, carried the message into the darkness
behind him, and the easy, uncounted Eastern minutes slid by; for the
lama was asleep in his cell, and no priest would wake him.  When the
click of his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the
calm images of the Arhats stand, a novice whispered, 'Thy chela is
here,' and the old man strode forth, forgetting the end of that prayer.

Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before
him, and, lifting up the child, cried:  'Look upon this, Holy One; and
if the Gods will, he lives--he lives!'

He fumbled in his waist-belt and drew out a small silver coin.

'What is now?'  The lama's eyes turned to Kim.  It was noticeable he
spoke far clearer Urdu than long ago, under ZamZammah; but father would
allow no private talk.

'It is no more than a fever,' said Kim.  'The child is not well fed.'

'He sickens at everything, and his mother is not here.'

'If it be permitted, I may cure, Holy One.'

'What!  Have they made thee a healer?  Wait here,' said the lama, and
he sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple, while Kim,
looking out of the corner of his eyes, slowly opened the little
betel-box.  He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as
a Sahib--of chaffing the old man before he revealed himself--boy's
dreams all.  There was more drama in this abstracted, brow-puckered
search through the tabloid-bottles, with a pause here and there for
thought and a muttered invocation between whiles.  Quinine he had in
tablets, and dark brown meat-lozenges--beef most probably, but that was
not his business.  The little thing would not eat, but it sucked at a
lozenge greedily, and said it liked the salt taste.

'Take then these six.'  Kim handed them to the man.  'Praise the Gods,
and boil three in milk; other three in water.  After he has drunk the
milk give him this' (it was the half of a quinine pill), 'and wrap him
warm.  Give him the water of the other three, and the other half of
this white pill when he wakes.  Meantime, here is another brown
medicine that he may suck at on the way home.'

'Gods, what wisdom!'  said the Kamboh, snatching.

It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of
autumn malaria--if you except the patter that he added to impress the
lama.

'Now go!  Come again in the morning.'

'But the price--the price,' said the Jat, and threw back his sturdy
shoulders.  'My son is my son.  Now that he will be whole again, how
shall I go back to his mother and say I took help by the wayside and
did not even give a bowl of curds in return?'

'They are alike, these Jats,' said Kim softly.  'The Jat stood on his
dunghill and the King's elephants went by.  "O driver," said he, "what
will you sell those little donkeys for?"'

The Jat burst into a roar of laughter, stifled with apologies to the
lama.  'It is the saying of my own country the very talk of it.  So are
we Jats all.  I will come tomorrow with the child; and the blessing of
the Gods of the Homesteads--who are good little Gods--be on you both
...  Now, son, we grow strong again.  Do not spit it out, little
Princeling!  King of my Heart, do not spit it out, and we shall be
strong men, wrestlers and club-wielders, by morning.'

He moved away, crooning and mumbling.  The lama turned to Kim, and all
the loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes.

'To heal the sick is to acquire merit; but first one gets knowledge.
That was wisely done, O Friend of all the World.'

'I was made wise by thee, Holy One,' said Kim, forgetting the little
play just ended; forgetting St Xavier's; forgetting his white blood;
forgetting even the Great Game as he stooped, Mohammedan-fashion, to
touch his master's feet in the dust of the Jain temple.  'My teaching I
owe to thee.  I have eaten thy bread three years.  My time is finished.
I am loosed from the schools.  I come to thee.'

'Herein is my reward.  Enter!  Enter!  And is all well?'  They passed
to the inner court, where the afternoon sun sloped golden across.
'Stand that I may see.  So!'  He peered critically.  'It is no longer a
child, but a man, ripened in wisdom, walking as a physician.  I did
well--I did well when I gave thee up to the armed men on that black
night.  Dost thou remember our first day under Zam-Zammah?'

'Ay,' said Kim.  'Dost thou remember when I leapt off the carriage the
first day I went to--'

'The Gates of Learning?  Truly.  And the day that we ate the cakes
together at the back of the river by Nucklao.  Aha!  Many times hast
thou begged for me, but that day I begged for thee.'

'Good reason,' quoth Kim.  'I was then a scholar in the Gates of
Learning, and attired as a Sahib.  Do not forget, Holy One,' he went on
playfully.  'I am still a Sahib--by thy favour.'

'True.  And a Sahib in most high esteem.  Come to my cell, chela.'

'How is that known to thee?'

The lama smiled.  'First by means of letters from the kindly priest
whom we met in the camp of armed men; but he is now gone to his own
country, and I sent the money to his brother.'  Colonel Creighton, who
had succeeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England
with the Mavericks, was hardly the Chaplain's brother.  'But I do not
well understand Sahibs' letters.  They must be interpreted to me.  I
chose a surer way.  Many times when I returned from my Search to this
Temple, which has always been a nest to me, there came one seeking
Enlightenment--a man from Leh--that had been, he said, a Hindu, but
wearied of all those Gods.'  The lama pointed to the Arhats.

'A fat man?'  said Kim, a twinkle in his eye.

'Very fat; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to
useless things--such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of
our tea-drinkings in the monasteries, and by what road we initiated the
novices.  A man abounding in questions; but he was a friend of thine,
chela.  He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a
scribe.  And I see thou art a physician.'

'Yes, that am I--a scribe, when I am a Sahib, but it is set aside when
I come as thy disciple.  I have accomplished the years appointed for a
Sahib.'

'As it were a novice?'  said the lama, nodding his head.  'Art thou
freed from the schools?  I would not have thee unripe.'

'I am all free.  In due time I take service under the Government as a
scribe--'

'Not as a warrior.  That is well.'

'But first I come to wander with thee.  Therefore I am here.  Who begs
for thee, these days?'  he went on quickly.  The ice was thin.

'Very often I beg myself; but, as thou knowest, I am seldom here,
except when I come to look again at my disciple.  From one end to
another of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the te-rain.  A great and
a wonderful land!  But here, when I put in, is as though I were in my
own Bhotiyal.'

He looked round the little clean cell complacently.  A low cushion gave
him a seat, on which he had disposed himself in the cross-legged
attitude of the Bodhisat emerging from meditation; a black teak-wood
table, not twenty inches high, set with copper tea-cups, was before
him.  In one corner stood a tiny altar, also of heavily carved teak,
bearing a copper-gilt image of the seated Buddha and fronted by a lamp,
an incense-holder, and a pair of copper flower-pots.

'The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving
me these a year since,' he said, following Kim's eye.  'When one is far
from one's own land such things carry remembrance; and we must
reverence the Lord for that He showed the Way.  See!'  He pointed to a
curiously-built mound of coloured rice crowned with a fantastic metal
ornament.  'When I was Abbot in my own place--before I came to better
knowledge I made that offering daily.  It is the Sacrifice of the
Universe to the Lord.  Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily
to the Excellent Law.  And I do it even now, though I know that the
Excellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings.'  He snuffed from
his gourd.

'It is well done, Holy One,' Kim murmured, sinking at ease on the
cushions, very happy and rather tired.

'And also,' the old man chuckled, 'I write pictures of the Wheel of
Life.  Three days to a picture.  I was busied on it--or it may be I
shut my eyes a little--when they brought word of thee.  It is good to
have thee here:  I will show thee my art--not for pride's sake, but
because thou must learn.  The Sahibs have not all this world's wisdom.'

He drew from under the table a sheet of strangely scented yellow
Chinese paper, the brushes, and slab of Indian ink.  In cleanest,
severest outline he had traced the Great Wheel with its six spokes,
whose centre is the conjoined Hog, Snake, and Dove (Ignorance, Anger,
and Lust), and whose compartments are all the Heavens and Hells, and
all the chances of human life.  Men say that the Bodhisat Himself first
drew it with grains of rice upon dust, to teach His disciples the cause
of things.  Many ages have crystallized it into a most wonderful
convention crowded with hundreds of little figures whose every line
carries a meaning.  Few can translate the picture-parable; there are
not twenty in all the world who can draw it surely without a copy:  of
those who can both draw and expound are but three.

'I have a little learned to draw,' said Kim.  'But this is a marvel
beyond marvels.'

'I have written it for many years,' said the lama.  'Time was when I
could write it all between one lamp-lighting and the next.  I will
teach thee the art--after due preparation; and I will show thee the
meaning of the Wheel.'

'We take the Road, then?'

'The Road and our Search.  I was but waiting for thee.  It was made
plain to me in a hundred dreams--notably one that came upon the night
of the day that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I
should never find my River.  Again and again, as thou knowest, I put
this from me, fearing an illusion.  Therefore I would not take thee
with me that day at Lucknow, when we ate the cakes.  I would not take
thee till the time was ripe and auspicious.  From the Hills to the Sea,
from the Sea to the Hills have I gone, but it was vain. Then I
remembered the Tataka.'

He told Kim the story of the elephant with the leg-iron, as he had told
it so often to the Jam priests.

'Further testimony is not needed,' he ended serenely.  'Thou wast sent
for an aid.  That aid removed, my Search came to naught. Therefore we
will go out again together, and our Search sure.'

'Whither go we?'

'What matters, Friend of all the World?  The Search, I say, is sure. If
need be, the River will break from the ground before us.  I acquired
merit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning, and gave thee the
jewel that is Wisdom.  Thou didst return, I saw even now, a follower of
Sakyamuni, the Physician, whose altars are many in Bhotiyal.  It is
sufficient.  We are together, and all things are as they were--Friend
of all the World--Friend of the Stars--my chela!'

Then they talked of matters secular; but it was noticeable that the
lama never demanded any details of life at St Xavier's, nor showed the
faintest curiosity as to the manners and customs of Sahibs.  His mind
moved all in the past, and he revived every step of their wonderful
first journey together, rubbing his hands and chuckling, till it
pleased him to curl himself up into the sudden sleep of old age.

Kim watched the last dusty sunshine fade out of the court, and played
with his ghost-dagger and rosary.  The clamour of Benares, oldest of
all earth's cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the
walls as the sea's roar round a breakwater.  Now and again, a Jain
priest crossed the court, with some small offering to the images, and
swept the path about him lest by chance he should take the life of a
living thing.  A lamp twinkled, and there followed the sound of a
prayer.  Kim watched the stars as they rose one after another in the
still, sticky dark, till he fell asleep at the foot of the altar.  That
night he dreamed in Hindustani, with never an English word...

'Holy One, there is the child to whom we gave the medicine,' he said,
about three o'clock in the morning, when the lama, also waking from
dreams, would have fared forth on pilgrimage.  'The Jat will be here at
the light.'

'I am well answered.  In my haste I would have done a wrong.'  He sat
down on the cushions and returned to his rosary.  'Surely old folk are
as children,' he said pathetically.  'They desire a matter--behold, it
must be done at once, or they fret and weep!  Many times when I was
upon the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance
of an ox-cart in the way, or a mere cloud of dust. It was not so when I
was a man--a long time ago.  None the less it is wrongful--'

'But thou art indeed old, Holy One.'

'The thing was done.  A Cause was put out into the world, and, old or
young, sick or sound, knowing or unknowing, who can rein in the effect
of that Cause?  Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it--or a
drunkard?  Chela, this is a great and a terrible world.'

'I think it good,' Kim yawned.  'What is there to eat?  I have not
eaten since yesterday even.'

'I had forgotten thy need.  Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice.'

'We cannot walk far on such stuff.'  Kim felt all the European's lust
for flesh-meat, which is not accessible in a Jain temple.  Yet, instead
of going out at once with the begging-bowl, he stayed his stomach on
slabs of cold rice till the full dawn.  It brought the farmer, voluble,
stuttering with gratitude.

'In the night the fever broke and the sweat came,' he cried.  'Feel
here--his skin is fresh and new!  He esteemed the salt lozenges, and
took milk with greed.'  He drew the cloth from the child's face, and it
smiled sleepily at Kim.  A little knot of Jain priests, silent but
all-observant, gathered by the temple door.  They knew, and Kim knew
that they knew, how the old lama had met his disciple.  Being courteous
folk, they had not obtruded themselves overnight by presence, word, or
gesture.  Wherefore Kim repaid them as the sun rose.

'Thank the Gods of the Jains, brother,' he said, not knowing how those
Gods were named.  'The fever is indeed broken.'

'Look!  See!'  The lama beamed in the background upon his hosts of
three years.  'Was there ever such a chela?  He follows our Lord the
Healer.'

Now the Jains officially recognize all the Gods of the Hindu creed, as
well as the Lingam and the Snake.  They wear the Brahminical thread;
they adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law.  But, because they knew
and loved the lama, because he was an old man, because he sought the
Way, because he was their guest, and because he collogued long of
nights with the head-priest--as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever
split one hair into seventy--they murmured assent.

'Remember,'--Kim bent over the child--.  'this trouble may come again.'

'Not if thou hast the proper spell,' said the father.

'But in a little while we go away.'

'True,' said the lama to all the Jains.  'We go now together upon the
Search whereof I have often spoken.  I waited till my chela was ripe.
Behold him!  We go North.  Never again shall I look upon this place of
my rest, O people of good will.'

'But I am not a beggar.'  The cultivator rose to his feet, clutching
the child.

'Be still.  Do not trouble the Holy One,' a priest cried.

'Go,' Kim whispered.  'Meet us again under the big railway bridge, and
for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab, bring food--curry, pulse,
cakes fried in fat, and sweetmeats.  Specially sweetmeats.  Be swift!'

The pallor of hunger suited Kim very well as he stood, tall and slim,
in his sand-coloured, sweeping robes, one hand on his rosary and the
other in the attitude of benediction, faithfully copied from the lama.
An English observer might have said that he looked rather like the
young saint of a stained-glass window, whereas he was but a growing lad
faint with emptiness.

Long and formal were the farewells, thrice ended and thrice renewed.
The Seeker--he who had invited the lama to that haven from far-away
Tibet, a silver-faced, hairless ascetic--took no part in it, but
meditated, as always, alone among the images.  The others were very
human; pressing small comforts upon the old man--a betel-box, a fine
new iron pencase, a food-bag, and such-like--warning him against the
dangers of the world without, and prophesying a happy end to the
Search.  Meantime Kim, lonelier than ever, squatted on the steps, and
swore to himself in the language of St Xavier's.

'But it is my own fault,' he concluded.  'With Mahbub, I ate Mahbub's
bread, or Lurgan Sahib's.  At St Xavier's, three meals a day.  Here I
must jolly-well look out for myself.  Besides, I am not in good
training.  How I could eat a plate of beef now!  ...  Is it finished,
Holy One?'

The lama, both hands raised, intoned a final blessing in ornate
Chinese.  'I must lean on thy shoulder,' said he, as the temple gates
closed.  'We grow stiff, I think.'

The weight of a six-foot man is not light to steady through miles of
crowded streets, and Kim, loaded down with bundles and packages for the
way, was glad to reach the shadow of the railway bridge.

'Here we eat,' he said resolutely, as the Kamboh, blue-robed and
smiling, hove in sight, a basket in one hand and the child in the other.

'Fall to, Holy Ones!'  he cried from fifty yards.  (They were by the
shoal under the first bridge-span, out of sight of hungry priests.)
'Rice and good curry, cakes all warm and well scented with hing
[asafoetida], curds and sugar.  King of my fields,'--this to the small
son--'let us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a
service ...  I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not
cooked, but truly'--he looked away politely over the broad
river--'where there is no eye there is no caste.'

'And we,' said Kim, turning his back and heaping a leafplatter for the
lama, 'are beyond all castes.'

They gorged themselves on the good food in silence.  Nor till he had
licked the last of the sticky sweetstuff from his little finger did Kim
note that the Kamboh too was girt for travel.

'If our roads lie together,' he said roughly, 'I go with thee.  One
does not often find a worker of miracles, and the child is still weak.
But I am not altogether a reed.'  He picked up his lathi--a five-foot
male-bamboo ringed with bands of polished iron--and flourished it in
the air.  'The Jats are called quarrel-some, but that is not true.
Except when we are crossed, we are like our own buffaloes.'

'So be it,' said Kim.  'A good stick is a good reason.'

The lama gazed placidly up-stream, where in long, smudged perspective
the ceaseless columns of smoke go up from the burning-ghats by the
river.  Now and again, despite all municipal regulations, the fragment
of a half-burned body bobbed by on the full current.

'But for thee,' said the Kamboh to Kim, drawing the child into his
hairy breast, 'I might today have gone thither--with this one.  The
priests tell us that Benares is holy--which none doubt--and desirable
to die in.  But I do not know their Gods, and they ask for money; and
when one has done one worship a shaved-head vows it is of none effect
except one do another.  Wash here!  Wash there!  Pour, drink, lave, and
scatter flowers--but always pay the priests.  No, the Punjab for me,
and the soil of the Jullundur-doab for the best soil in it.'

'I have said many times--in the Temple, I think--that if need be, the
River will open at our feet.  We will therefore go North,' said the
lama, rising.  'I remember a pleasant place, set about with
fruit-trees, where one can walk in meditation--and the air is cooler
there.  It comes from the Hills and the snow of the Hills.'

'What is the name?'  said Kim.

'How should I know?  Didst thou not--no, that was after the Army rose
out of the earth and took thee away.  I abode there in meditation in a
room against the dovecot--except when she talked eternally.'

'Oho!  the woman from Kulu.  That is by Saharunpore.'  Kim laughed.

'How does the spirit move thy master?  Does he go afoot, for the sake
of past sins?'  the Jat demanded cautiously.  'It is a far cry to
Delhi.'

'No,' said Kim.  'I will beg a tikkut for the te-rain.'  One does not
own to the possession of money in India.

'Then, in the name of the Gods, let us take the fire-carriage.  My son
is best in his mother's arms.  The Government has brought on us many
taxes, but it gives us one good thing--the te-rain that joins friends
and unites the anxious.  A wonderful matter is the te-rain.'

They all piled into it a couple of hours later, and slept through the
heat of the day.  The Kamboh plied Kim with ten thousand questions as
to the lama's walk and work in life, and received some curious answers.
Kim was content to be where he was, to look out upon the flat
North-Western landscape, and to talk to the changing mob of
fellow-passengers.  Even today, tickets and ticket-clipping are dark
oppression to Indian rustics.  They do not understand why, when they
have paid for a magic piece of paper, strangers should punch great
pieces out of the charm.  So, long and furious are the debates between
travellers and Eurasian ticket-collectors.  Kim assisted at two or
three with grave advice, meant to darken counsel and to show off his
wisdom before the lama and the admiring Kamboh.  But at Somna Road the
Fates sent him a matter to think upon.  There tumbled into the
compartment, as the train was moving off, a mean, lean little person--a
Mahratta, so far as Kim could judge by the cock of the tight turban.
His face was cut, his muslin upper-garment was badly torn, and one leg
was bandaged.  He told them that a country-cart had upset and nearly
slain him:  he was going to Delhi, where his son lived.  Kim watched
him closely. If, as he asserted, he had been rolled over and over on
the earth, there should have been signs of gravel-rash on the skin.
But all his injuries seemed clean cuts, and a mere fall from a cart
could not cast a man into such extremity of terror.  As, with shaking
fingers, he knotted up the torn cloth about his neck he laid bare an
amulet of the kind called a keeper-up of the heart.  Now, amulets are
common enough, but they are not generally strung on square-plaited
copper wire, and still fewer amulets bear black enamel on silver.
There were none except the Kamboh and the lama in the compartment,
which, luckily, was of an old type with solid ends.  Kim made as to
scratch in his bosom, and thereby lifted his own amulet.  The
Mahratta's face changed altogether at the sight, and he disposed the
amulet fairly on his breast.

'Yes,' he went on to the Kamboh, 'I was in haste, and the cart, driven
by a bastard, bound its wheel in a water-cut, and besides the harm done
to me there was lost a full dish of tarkeean.  I was not a Son of the
Charm [a lucky man] that day.'

'That was a great loss,' said the Kamboh, withdrawing interest.  His
experience of Benares had made him suspicious.

'Who cooked it?'  said Kim.

'A woman.'  The Mahratta raised his eyes.

'But all women can cook tarkeean,' said the Kamboh.  'It is a good
curry, as I know.'

'Oh yes, it is a good curry,' said the Mahratta.

'And cheap,' said Kim.  'But what about caste?'

'Oh, there is no caste where men go to--look for tarkeean,' the
Mahratta replied, in the prescribed cadence.  'Of whose service art
thou?'

'Of the service of this Holy One.'  Kim pointed to the happy, drowsy
lama, who woke with a jerk at the well-loved word.

'Ah, he was sent from Heaven to aid me.  He is called the Friend of all
the World.  He is also called the Friend of the Stars.  He walks as a
physician--his time being ripe.  Great is his wisdom.'

'And a Son of the Charm,' said Kim under his breath, as the Kamboh made
haste to prepare a pipe lest the Mahratta should beg.

'And who is that?'  the Mahratta asked, glancing sideways nervously.

'One whose child I--we have cured, who lies under great debt to us. Sit
by the window, man from Jullundur.  Here is a sick one.'

'Humph!  I have no desire to mix with chance-met wastrels.  My ears are
not long.  I am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets.'  The Jat slid
himself heavily into a far corner.

'Art thou anything of a healer?  I am ten leagues deep in calamity,'
cried the Mahratta, picking up the cue.

'This man is cut and bruised all over.  I go about to cure him,' Kim
retorted.  'None interfered between thy babe and me.'

'I am rebuked,' said the Kamboh meekly.  'I am thy debtor for the life
of my son.  Thou art a miracle-worker--I know it.'

'Show me the cuts.'  Kim bent over the Mahratta's neck, his heart
nearly choking him; for this was the Great Game with a vengeance. 'Now,
tell thy tale swiftly, brother, while I say a charm.'

'I come from the South, where my work lay.  One of us they slew by the
roadside.  Hast thou heard?'  Kim shook his head.  He, of course, knew
nothing of E's predecessor, slain down South in the habit of an Arab
trader.  'Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I
came away.  I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow.  So sure was I
that none knew, I did not change my face.  At Mhow a woman brought
charge against me of theft of jewellery in that city which I had left.
Then I saw the cry was out against me.  I ran from Mhow by night,
bribing the police, who had been bribed to hand me over without
question to my enemies in the South.  Then I lay in old Chitor city a
week, a penitent in a temple, but I could not get rid of the letter
which was my charge.  I buried it under the Queen's Stone, at Chitor,
in the place known to us all.'

Kim did not know, but not for worlds would he have broken the thread.

'At Chitor, look you, I was all in Kings' country; for Kotah to the
east is beyond the Queen's law, and east again lie Jaipur and Gwalior.
Neither love spies, and there is no justice.  I was hunted like a wet
jackal; but I broke through at Bandakui, where I heard there was a
charge against me of murder in the city I had left--of the murder of a
boy.  They have both the corpse and the witnesses waiting.'

'But cannot the Government protect?'

'We of the Game are beyond protection.  If we die, we die.  Our names
are blotted from the book.  That is all.  At Bandakui, where lives one
of Us, I thought to slip the scent by changing my face, and so made me
a Mahratta.  Then I came to Agra, and would have turned back to Chitor
to recover the letter.  So sure I was I had slipped them. Therefore I
did not send a tar [telegram] to any one saying where the letter lay.
I wished the credit of it all.'

Kim nodded.  He understood that feeling well.

'But at Agra, walking in the streets, a man cried a debt against me,
and approaching with many witnesses, would hale me to the courts then
and there.  Oh, they are clever in the South!  He recognized me as his
agent for cotton.  May he burn in Hell for it!'

'And wast thou?'

'O fool!  I was the man they sought for the matter of the letter!  I
ran into the Fleshers' Ward and came out by the House of the Jew, who
feared a riot and pushed me forth.  I came afoot to Somna Road--I had
only money for my tikkut to Delhi--and there, while I lay in a ditch
with a fever, one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and
searched me from head to foot.  Within earshot of the terain it was!'

'Why did he not slay thee out of hand?'

'They are not so foolish.  If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of
lawyers, upon a proven charge of murder, my body is handed over to the
State that desires it.  I go back guarded, and then--I die slowly for
an example to the rest of Us.  The South is not my country.  I run in
circles--like a goat with one eye.  I have not eaten for two days.  I
am marked'--he touched the filthy bandage on his leg--'so that they
will know me at Delhi.'

'Thou art safe in the te-rain, at least.'

'Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again!  The wires will
be out against me at Delhi, describing every tear and rag upon me.
Twenty--a hundred, if need be--will have seen me slay that boy.  And
thou art useless!'

Kim knew enough of native methods of attack not to doubt that the case
would be deadly complete--even to the corpse.  The Mahratta twitched
his fingers with pain from time to time.  The Kamboh in his corner
glared sullenly; the lama was busy over his beads; and Kim, fumbling
doctor-fashion at the man's neck, thought out his plan between
invocations.

'Hast thou a charm to change my shape?  Else I am dead.  Five--ten
minutes alone, if I had not been so pressed, and I might--'

'Is he cured yet, miracle-worker?'  said the Kamboh jealously.  'Thou
hast chanted long enough.'

'Nay.  There is no cure for his hurts, as I see, except he sit for
three days in the habit of a bairagi.'  This is a common penance, often
imposed on a fat trader by his spiritual teacher.

'One priest always goes about to make another priest,' was the retort.
Like most grossly superstitious folk, the Kamboh could not keep his
tongue from deriding his Church.

'Will thy son be a priest, then?  It is time he took more of my
quinine.'

'We Jats are all buffaloes,' said the Kamboh, softening anew.

Kim rubbed a finger-tip of bitterness on the child's trusting little
lips.  'I have asked for nothing,' he said sternly to the father,
'except food.  Dost thou grudge me that?  I go to heal another man.
Have I thy leave--Prince?'

Up flew the man's huge paws in supplication.  'Nay--nay.  Do not mock
me thus.'

'It pleases me to cure this sick one.  Thou shalt acquire merit by
aiding.  What colour ash is there in thy pipe-bowl?  White.  That is
auspicious.  Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs?'

'I--I--'

'Open thy bundle!'

It was the usual collection of small oddments:  bits of cloth, quack
medicines, cheap fairings, a clothful of atta--greyish, rough-ground
native flour--twists of down-country tobacco, tawdry pipe-stems, and a
packet of curry-stuff, all wrapped in a quilt.  Kim turned it over with
the air of a wise warlock, muttering a Mohammedan invocation.

'This is wisdom I learned from the Sahibs,' he whispered to the lama;
and here, when one thinks of his training at Lurgan's, he spoke no more
than the truth.  'There is a great evil in this man's fortune, as shown
by the Stars, which--which troubles him.  Shall I take it away?'

'Friend of the Stars, thou hast done well in all things.  Let it be at
thy pleasure.  Is it another healing?'

'Quick!  Be quick!'  gasped the Mahratta.  'The train may stop.'

'A healing against the shadow of death,' said Kim, mixing the Kamboh's
flour with the mingled charcoal and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl
of the pipe.  E, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down
his long black hair.


'That is my food--priest,' the jat growled.

'A buffalo in the temple!  Hast thou dared to look even thus far?' said
Kim.  'I must do mysteries before fools; but have a care for thine
eyes.  Is there a film before them already?  I save the babe, and for
return thou--oh, shameless!'  The man flinched at the direct gaze, for
Kim was wholly in earnest.

'Shall I curse thee, or shall I--' He picked up the outer cloth of the
bundle and threw it over the bowed head.  'Dare so much as to think a
wish to see, and--and--even I cannot save thee.  Sit!  Be dumb!'

'I am blind--dumb.  Forbear to curse!  Co--come, child; we will play a
game of hiding.  Do not, for my sake, look from under the cloth.'

'I see hope,' said E23.  'What is thy scheme?'

'This comes next,' said Kim, plucking the thin body-shirt.  E23
hesitated, with all a North-West man's dislike of baring his body.

'What is caste to a cut throat?'  said Kim, rending it to the waist.
'We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over.  Strip--strip swiftly, and
shake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash. Now, a
caste-mark on thy forehead.'  He drew from his bosom the little Survey
paint-box and a cake of crimson lake.

'Art thou only a beginner?'  said E23, labouring literally for the dear
life, as he slid out of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the
loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared
brow.

'But two days entered to the Game, brother,' Kim replied.  'Smear more
ash on the bosom.'

'Hast thou met--a physician of sick pearls?'  He switched out his long,
tight-rolled turban-cloth and, with swiftest hands, rolled it over and
under about his loins into the intricate devices of a Saddhu's cincture.

'Hah!  Dost thou know his touch, then?  He was my teacher for a while.
We must bar thy legs.  Ash cures wounds.  Smear it again.'

'I was his pride once, but thou art almost better.  The Gods are kind
to us!  Give me that.'

It was a tin box of opium pills among the rubbish of the Jat's bundle.
E23 gulped down a half handful.  'They are good against hunger, fear,
and chill.  And they make the eyes red too,' he explained.  'Now I
shall have heart to play the Game.  We lack only a Saddhu's tongs.
What of the old clothes?'

Kim rolled them small, and stuffed them into the slack folds of his
tunic.  With a yellow-ochre paint cake he smeared the legs and the
breast, great streaks against the background of flour, ash, and
turmeric.

'The blood on them is enough to hang thee, brother.'

'Maybe; but no need to throw them out of the window ...  It is
finished.'  His voice thrilled with a boy's pure delight in the Game.
'Turn and look, O Jat!'

'The Gods protect us,' said the hooded Kamboh, emerging like a buffalo
from the reeds.  'But--whither went the Mahratta?  What hast thou done?'

Kim had been trained by Lurgan Sahib; E23, by virtue of his business,
was no bad actor.  In place of the tremulous, shrinking trader there
lolled against the corner an all but naked, ash-smeared, ochre-barred,
dusty-haired Saddhu, his swollen eyes--opium takes quick effect on an
empty stomach--luminous with insolence and bestial lust, his legs
crossed under him, Kim's brown rosary round his neck, and a scant yard
of worn, flowered chintz on his shoulders.  The child buried his face
in his amazed father's arms.

'Look up, Princeling!  We travel with warlocks, but they will not hurt
thee.  Oh, do not cry ...  What is the sense of curing a child one day
and killing him with fright the next?'

'The child will be fortunate all his life.  He has seen a great
healing.  When I was a child I made clay men and horses.'

'I have made them too.  Sir Banas, he comes in the night and makes them
all alive at the back of our kitchen-midden,' piped the child.

'And so thou art not frightened at anything.  Eh, Prince?'

'I was frightened because my father was frightened.  I felt his arms
shake.'

'Oh, chicken-man!'  said Kim, and even the abashed Jat laughed.  'I
have done a healing on this poor trader.  He must forsake his gains and
his account-books, and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the
malignity of his enemies.  The Stars are against him.'

'The fewer money-lenders the better, say I; but, Saddhu or no Saddhu,
he should pay for my stuff on his shoulders.'

'So?  But that is thy child on thy shoulder--given over to the
burning-ghat not two days ago.  There remains one thing more.  I did
this charm in thy presence because need was great.  I changed his shape
and his soul.  None the less, if, by any chance, O man from Jullundur,
thou rememberest what thou hast seen, either among the elders sitting
under the village tree, or in thine own house, or in company of thy
priest when he blesses thy cattle, a murrain will come among the
buffaloes, and a fire in thy thatch, and rats in the corn-bins, and the
curse of our Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren before thy
feet and after thy ploughshare.' This was part of an old curse picked
up from a fakir by the Taksali Gate in the days of Kim's innocence.  It
lost nothing by repetition.

'Cease, Holy One!  In mercy, cease!'  cried the Jat.  'Do not curse the
household.  I saw nothing!  I heard nothing!  I am thy cow!'  and he
made to grab at Kim's bare foot beating rhythmically on the carriage
floor.  'But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of
a pinch of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured
by using in my art, so will the Gods return a blessing,' and he gave it
at length, to the man's immense relief.  It was one that he had learned
from Lurgan Sahib.

The lama stared through his spectacles as he had not stared at the
business of disguisement.  'Friend of the Stars,' he said at last,
'thou hast acquired great wisdom.  Beware that it do not give birth to
pride.  No man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any
matter which he has seen or encountered.'

'No--no--no, indeed,' cried the farmer, fearful lest the master should
be minded to improve on the pupil.  E23, with relaxed mouth, gave
himself up to the opium that is meat, tobacco, and medicine to the
spent Asiatic.

So, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into
Delhi about lamp-lighting time.




Chapter 12


  Who hath desired the Sea--the sight of salt-water unbounded?
  The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber
      wind-hounded?
  The sleek-barrelled swell before storm--grey, foamless, enormous,
      and growing?
  Stark calm on the lap of the Line--or the crazy-eyed hurricane
      blowing?
  His Sea in no showing the same--his Sea and the same 'neath all
      showing--
  His Sea that his being fulfils?
  So and no otherwise--so and no otherwise hill-men desire their Hills!

  The Sea and the Hills.


'I have found my heart again,' said E23, under cover of the platform's
tumult.  'Hunger and fear make men dazed, or I might have thought of
this escape before.  I was right.  They come to hunt for me.  Thou hast
saved my head.'

A group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot and
perspiring young Englishman, parted the crowd about the carriages.
Behind them, inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person who
looked like a lawyer's tout.

'See the young Sahib reading from a paper.  My description is in his
hand,' said E23.  'Thev go carriage by carriage, like fisher-folk
netting a pool.'

When the procession reached their compartment, E23 was counting his
beads with a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him for
being so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the
Saddhu's distinguishing mark.  The lama, deep in meditation, stared
straight before him; and the farmer, glancing furtively, gathered up
his belongings.

'Nothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,' said the Englishman aloud,
and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native police mean
extortion to the native all India over.

'The trouble now,' whispered E23, 'lies in sending a wire as to the
place where I hid that letter I was sent to find.  I cannot go to the
tar-office in this guise.'

'Is it not enough I have saved thy neck?'

'Not if the work be left unfinished.  Did never the healer of sick
pearls tell thee so?  Comes another Sahib!  Ah!'

This was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of Police--belt,
helmet, polished spurs and all--strutting and twirling his dark
moustache.

'What fools are these Police Sahibs!'  said Kim genially.

E23 glanced up under his eyelids.  'It is well said,' he muttered in a
changed voice.  'I go to drink water.  Keep my place.'

He blundered out almost into the Englishman's arms, and was bad-worded
in clumsy Urdu.

'Tum mut?  You drunk?  You mustn't bang about as though Delhi station
belonged to you, my friend.'

E23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a stream of
the filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced.  It reminded him
of the drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible
time of his first schooling.

'My good fool,' the Englishman drawled.  'Nickle-jao!  Go back to your
carriage.'

Step by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice, the
yellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P. to
remotest posterity, by--here Kim almost jumped--by the curse of the
Queen's Stone, by the writing under the Queen's Stone, and by an
assortment of Gods with wholly, new names.

'I don't know what you're saying,'--the Englishman flushed
angrily--'but it's some piece of blasted impertinence.  Come out of
that!'

E23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket, which the
Englishman wrenched angrily from his hand.

'Oh, zoolum!  What oppression!'  growled the Jat from his corner. 'All
for the sake of a jest too.'  He had been grinning at the freedom of
the Saddhu's tongue.  'Thy charms do not work well today, Holy One!'

The Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating.  The ruck
of passengers, busy, with their babies and their bundles, had not
noticed the affair.  Kim slipped out behind him; for it flashed through
his head that he had heard this angry, stupid Sahib discoursing loud
personalities to an old lady near Umballa three years ago.

'It is well', the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling, shouting,
bewildered press--a Persian greyhound between his feet and a cageful of
yelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his
back.  'He has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid.  They
told me he was in Peshawur.  I might have known that he is like the
crocodile--always at the other ford.  He has saved me from present
calamity, but I owe my life to thee.'

'Is he also one of Us?'  Kim ducked under a Mewar camel-driver's greasy
armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons.

'Not less than the greatest.  We are both fortunate!  I will make
report to him of what thou hast done.  I am safe under his protection.'

He bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages, and
squatted by the bench near the telegraph-office.

'Return, or they take thy place!  Have no fear for the work,
brother--or my life.  Thou hast given me breathing-space, and
Strickland Sahib has pulled me to land.  We may work together at the
Game yet. Farewell!'

Kim hurried to his carriage:  elated, bewildered, but a little nettled
in that he had no key to the secrets about him.

'I am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure.  I could not have
leaped into safety as did the Saddhu.  He knew it was darkest under the
lamp.  I could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing
...  and how clever was the Sahib!  No matter, I saved the life of one
...  Where is the Kamboh gone, Holy One?'  he whispered, as he took his
seat in the now crowded compartment.

'A fear gripped him,' the lama replied, with a touch of tender malice.
'He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an
eye, as a protection against evil.  That shook him. Then he saw the
Saddhu fall sheer into the hands of the polis--all the effect of thy
art.  Then he gathered up his son and fled; for he said that thou didst
change a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the
Sahibs, and he feared a like fate.  Where is the Saddhu?'

'With the polis,' said Kim ...  'Yet I saved the Kamboh's child.'

The lama snuffed blandly.

'Ah, chela, see how thou art overtaken!  Thou didst cure the Kamboh's
child solely to acquire merit.  But thou didst put a spell on the
Mahratta with prideful workings--I watched thee--and with sidelong
glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer: whence
calamity and suspicion.'

Kim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years.  Not more than
any other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged, but he
saw himself in a cleft stick.  The train rolled out of Delhi into the
night.

'It is true,' he murmured.  'Where I have offended thee I have done
wrong.'

'It is more, chela.  Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world, and as a
stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell
how far.'

This ignorance was well both for Kim's vanity and for the lama's peace
of mind, when we think that there was then being handed in at Simla a
code-wire reporting the arrival of E23 at Delhi, and, more important,
the whereabouts of a letter he had been commissioned to--abstract.
Incidentally, an over-zealous policeman had arrested, on charge of
murder done in a far southern State, a horribly indignant Ajmir
cotton-broker, who was explaining himself to a Mr Strickland on Delhi
platform, while E23 was paddling through byways into the locked heart
of Delhi city.  In two hours several telegrams had reached the angry
minister of a southern State reporting that all trace of a somewhat
bruised Mahratta had been lost; and by the time the leisurely train
halted at Saharunpore the last ripple of the stone Kim had helped to
heave was lapping against the steps of a mosque in far-away Roum--where
it disturbed a pious man at prayers.

The lama made his in ample form near the dewy bougainvillea-trellis
near the platform, cheered by the clear sunshine and the presence of
his disciple.  'We will put these things behind us,' he said,
indicating the brazen engine and the gleaming track.  'The jolting of
the te-rain--though a wonderful thing--has turned my bones to water.
We will use clean air henceforward.'

'Let us go to the Kulu woman's house' said Kim, and stepped forth
cheerily under the bundles.  Early morning Saharunpore-way is clean and
well scented.  He thought of the other mornings at St Xavier's, and it
topped his already thrice-heaped contentment.

'Where is this new haste born from?  Wise men do not run about like
chickens in the sun.  We have come hundreds upon hundreds of koss
already, and, till now, I have scarcely been alone with thee an
instant.  How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of crowds? How
can I, whelmed by a flux of talk, meditate upon the Way?'

'Her tongue grows no shorter with the years, then?'  the disciple
smiled.

'Nor her desire for charms.  I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel
of Life'--the lama fumbled in his bosom for his latest copy--'she was
only curious about the devils that besiege children.  She shall acquire
merit by entertaining us--in a little while--at an
after-occasion--softly, softly.  Now we will wander loose-foot, waiting
upon the Chain of Things.  The Search is sure.'

So they travelled very easily across and among the broad bloomful
fruit-gardens--by way of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and
little Phulesa--the line of the Siwaliks always to the north, and
behind them again the snows.  After long, sweet sleep under the dry
stars came the lordly, leisurely passage through a waking
village--begging-bowl held forth in silence, but eyes roving in
defiance of the Law from sky's edge to sky's edge.  Then would Kim
return soft-footed through the soft dust to his master under the shadow
of a mango-tree or the thinner shade of a white Doon siris, to eat and
drink at ease.  At mid-day, after talk and a little wayfaring, they
slept; meeting the world refreshed when the air was cooler.  Night
found them adventuring into new territory--some chosen village spied
three hours before across the fat land, and much discussed upon the
road.

There they told their tale--a new one each evening so far as Kim was
concerned--and there were they made welcome, either by priest or
headman, after the custom of the kindly East.

When the shadows shortened and the lama leaned more heavily upon Kim,
there was always the Wheel of Life to draw forth, to hold flat under
wiped stones, and with a long straw to expound cycle by cycle. Here sat
the Gods on high--and they were dreams of dreams.  Here was our Heaven
and the world of the demi-Gods--horsemen fighting among the hills.
Here were the agonies done upon the beasts, souls ascending or
descending the ladder and therefore not to be interfered with.  Here
were the Hells, hot and cold, and the abodes of tormented ghosts.  Let
the chela study the troubles that come from over-eating--bloated
stomach and burning bowels.  Obediently, then, with bowed head and
brown finger alert to follow the pointer, did the chela study; but when
they came to the Human World, busy and profitless, that is just above
the Hells, his mind was distracted; for by the roadside trundled the
very Wheel itself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and
quarrelling--all warmly alive. Often the lama made the living pictures
the matter of his text, bidding Kim--too ready--note how the flesh
takes a thousand shapes, desirable or detestable as men reckon, but in
truth of no account either way; and how the stupid spirit, bond-slave
to the Hog, the Dove, and the Serpent--lusting after betel-nut, a new
yoke of oxen, women, or the favour of kings--is bound to follow the
body through all the Heavens and all the Hells, and strictly round
again. Sometimes a woman or a poor man, watching the ritual--it was
nothing less--when the great yellow chart was unfolded, would throw a
few flowers or a handful of cowries upon its edge.  It sufficed these
humble ones that they had met a Holy One who might be moved to remember
them in his prayers.

'Cure them if they are sick,' said the lama, when Kim's sporting
instincts woke.  'Cure them if they have fever, but by no means work
charms.  Remember what befell the Mahratta.'

'Then all Doing is evil?'  Kim replied, lying out under a big tree at
the fork of the Doon road, watching the little ants run over his hand.

'To abstain from action is well--except to acquire merit.'

'At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action
was unbefitting a Sahib.  And I am a Sahib.'

'Friend of all the World,'--the lama looked directly at Kim--'I am an
old man--pleased with shows as are children.  To those who follow the
Way there is neither black nor white, Hind nor Bhotiyal. We be all
souls seeking escape.  No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs,
when we come to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusion--at my
side.  Hai!  My bones ache for that River, as they ached in the
te-rain; but my spirit sits above my bones, waiting. The Search is
sure!'

'I am answered.  Is it permitted to ask a question?'

The lama inclined his stately head.

'I ate thy bread for three years--as thou knowest.  Holy One, whence
came--?'

'There is much wealth, as men count it, in Bhotiyal,' the lama returned
with composure.  'In my own place I have the illusion of honour.  I ask
for that I need.  I am not concerned with the account. That is for my
monastery.  Ai!  The black high seats in the monastery, and novices all
in order!'

And he told stories, tracing with a finger in the dust, of the immense
and sumptuous ritual of avalanche-guarded cathedrals; of processions
and devil-dances; of the changing of monks and nuns into swine; of holy
cities fifteen thousand feet in the air; of intrigue between monastery
and monastery; of voices among the hills, and of that mysterious mirage
that dances on dry snow.  He spoke even of Lhassa and of the Dalai
Lama, whom he had seen and adored.

Each long, perfect day rose behind Kim for a barrier to cut him off
from his race and his mother-tongue.  He slipped back to thinking and
dreaming in the vernacular, and mechanically followed the lama's
ceremonial observances at eating, drinking, and the like.  The old
man's mind turned more and more to his monastery as his eyes turned to
the steadfast snows.  His River troubled him nothing.  Now and again,
indeed, he would gaze long and long at a tuft or a twig, expecting, he
said, the earth to cleave and deliver its blessing; but he was content
to be with his disciple, at ease in the temperate wind that comes down
from the Doon.  This was not Ceylon, nor Buddh Gaya, nor Bombay, nor
some grass-tangled ruins that he seemed to have stumbled upon two years
ago.  He spoke of those places as a scholar removed from vanity, as a
Seeker walking in humility, as an old man, wise and temperate,
illumining knowledge with brilliant insight.  Bit by bit,
disconnectedly, each tale called up by some wayside thing, he spoke of
all his wanderings up and down Hind; till Kim, who had loved him
without reason, now loved him for fifty good reasons.  So they enjoyed
themselves in high felicity, abstaining, as the Rule demands, from evil
words, covetous desires; not over-eating, not lying on high beds, nor
wearing rich clothes.  Their stomachs told them the time, and the
people brought them their food, as the saying is.  They were lords of
the villages of Aminabad, Sahaigunge, Akrola of the Ford, and little
Phulesa, where Kim gave the soulless woman a blessing.

But news travels fast in India, and too soon shuffled across the
crop-land, bearing a basket of fruits with a box of Kabul grapes and
gilt oranges, a white-whiskered servitor--a lean, dry Oorya--begging
them to bring the honour of their presence to his mistress, distressed
in her mind that the lama had neglected her so long.

'Now do I remember'--the lama spoke as though it were a wholly new
proposition.  'She is virtuous, but an inordinate talker.'

Kim was sitting on the edge of a cow's manger, telling stories to a
village smith's children.

'She will only ask for another son for her daughter.  I have not
forgotten her,' he said.  'Let her acquire merit.  Send word that we
will come.'

They covered eleven miles through the fields in two days, and were
overwhelmed with attentions at the end; for the old lady held a fine
tradition of hospitality, to which she forced her son-in-law, who was
under the thumb of his women-folk and bought peace by borrowing of the
money-lender.  Age had not weakened her tongue or her memory, and from
a discreetly barred upper window, in the hearing of not less than a
dozen servants, she paid Kim compliments that would have flung European
audiences into unclean dismay.

'But thou art still the shameless beggar-brat of the parao,' she
shrilled.  'I have not forgotten thee.  Wash ye and eat.  The father of
my daughter's son is gone away awhile.  So we poor women are dumb and
useless.'

For proof, she harangued the entire household unsparingly till food and
drink were brought; and in the evening--the smoke-scented evening,
copper-dun and turquoise across the fields--it pleased her to order her
palanquin to be set down in the untidy forecourt by smoky torchlight;
and there, behind not too closely drawn curtains, she gossiped.

'Had the Holy One come alone, I should have received him otherwise; but
with this rogue, who can be too careful?'

'Maharanee,' said Kim, choosing as always the amplest title, 'is it my
fault that none other than a Sahib--a polis-Sahib--called the Maharanee
whose face he--' 'Chutt!  That was on the pilgrimage. When we
travel--thou knowest the proverb.'

'Called the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser of Delights?'

'To remember that!  It was true.  So he did.  That was in the time of
the bloom of my beauty.'  She chuckled like a contented parrot above
the sugar lump.  'Now tell me of thy goings and comings--as much as may
be without shame.  How many maids, and whose wives, hang upon thine
eyelashes?  Ye hail from Benares?  I would have gone there again this
year, but my daughter--we have only two sons.  Phaii!  Such is the
effect of these low plains.  Now in Kulu men are elephants.  But I
would ask thy Holy One--stand aside, rogue--a charm against most
lamentable windy colics that in mango-time overtake my daughter's
eldest.  Two years back he gave me a powerful spell.'

'Oh, Holy One!'  said Kim, bubbling with mirth at the lama's rueful
face.

'It is true.  I gave her one against wind.'

'Teeth--teeth--teeth,' snapped the old woman.

"'Cure them if they are sick,"' Kim quoted relishingly, "'but by no
means work charms.  Remember what befell the Mahratta."'

'That was two Rains ago; she wearied me with her continual
importunity.'  The lama groaned as the Unjust Judge had groaned before
him.  'Thus it comes--take note, my chela--that even those who would
follow the Way are thrust aside by idle women.  Three days through,
when the child was sick, she talked to me.'

'Arre!  and to whom else should I talk?  The boy's mother knew nothing,
and the father--in the nights of the cold weather it was--"Pray to the
Gods," said he, forsooth, and turning over, snored!'

'I gave her the charm.  What is an old man to do?'

"'To abstain from action is well--except to acquire merit."'

'Ah chela, if thou desertest me, I am all alone.'

'He found his milk-teeth easily at any rate,' said the old lady. 'But
all priests are alike.'

Kim coughed severely.  Being young, he did not approve of her
flippancy.  'To importune the wise out of season is to invite calamity.'

'There is a talking mynah'--the thrust came back with the
well-remembered snap of the jewelled fore-finger--'over the stables
which has picked up the very tone of the family priest.  Maybe I forget
honour to my guests, but if ye had seen him double his fists into his
belly, which was like a half-grown gourd, and cry:  "Here is the pain!"
ye would forgive.  I am half minded to take the hakim's medicine.  He
sells it cheap, and certainly it makes him fat as Shiv's own bull.  He
does not deny remedies, but I doubted for the child because of the
in-auspicious colour of the bottles.'

The lama, under cover of the monologue, had faded out into the darkness
towards the room prepared.

'Thou hast angered him, belike,' said Kim.

'Not he.  He is wearied, and I forgot, being a grandmother.  (None but
a grandmother should ever oversee a child.  Mothers are only fit for
bearing.) Tomorrow, when he sees how my daughter's son is grown, he
will write the charm.  Then, too, he can judge of the new hakim's
drugs.'

'Who is the hakim, Maharanee?'

'A wanderer, as thou art, but a most sober Bengali from Dacca--a master
of medicine.  He relieved me of an oppression after meat by means of a
small pill that wrought like a devil unchained.  He travels about now,
vending preparations of great value.  He has even papers, printed in
Angrezi, telling what things he has done for weak-backed men and slack
women.  He has been here four days; but hearing ye were coming (hakims
and priests are snake and tiger the world over) he has, as I take it,
gone to cover.'

While she drew breath after this volley, the ancient servant, sitting
unrebuked on the edge of the torchlight, muttered:  'This house is a
cattle-pound, as it were, for all charlatans and--priests. Let the boy
stop eating mangoes ...  but who can argue with a grandmother?'  He
raised his voice respectfully:  'Sahiba, the hakim sleeps after his
meat.  He is in the quarters behind the dovecote.'

Kim bristled like an expectant terrier.  To outface and down-talk a
Calcutta-taught Bengali, a voluble Dacca drug-vendor, would be a good
game.  It was not seemly that the lama, and incidentally himself,
should be thrown aside for such an one.  He knew those curious bastard
English advertisements at the backs of native newspapers.  St Xavier's
boys sometimes brought them in by stealth to snigger over among their
mates; for the language of the grateful patient recounting his symptoms
is most simple and revealing.  The Oorya, not unanxious to play off one
parasite against the other, slunk away towards the dovecote.

'Yes,' said Kim, with measured scorn.  'Their stock-in-trade is a
little coloured water and a very great shamelessness.  Their prey are
broken-down kings and overfed Bengalis.  Their profit is in
children--who are not born.'  The old lady chuckled.  'Do not be
envious. Charms are better, eh?  I never gainsaid it.  See that thy
Holy One writes me a good amulet by the morning.'

'None but the ignorant deny'--a thick, heavy voice boomed through the
darkness, as a figure came to rest squatting--'None but the ignorant
deny the value of charms.  None but the ignorant deny the value of
medicines.'

'A rat found a piece of turmeric.  Said he:  "I will open a grocer's
shop,"' Kim retorted.

Battle was fairly joined now, and they heard the old lady stiffen to
attention.

'The priest's son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods.  Says
he:  "Hear me, or I will curse you by the three million Great Ones."'
Decidedly this invisible had an arrow or two in his quiver.  He went
on:  'I am but a teacher of the alphabet.  I have learned all the
wisdom of the Sahibs.'

'The Sahibs never grow old.  They dance and they play like children
when they are grandfathers.  A strong-backed breed,' piped the voice
inside the palanquin.

'I have, too, our drugs which loosen humours of the head in hot and
angry men.  Sina well compounded when the moon stands in the proper
House; yellow earths I have--arplan from China that makes a man renew
his youth and astonish his household; saffron from Kashmir, and the
best salep of Kabul.  Many people have died before--'

'That I surely believe,' said Kim.

'They knew the value of my drugs.  I do not give my sick the mere ink
in which a charm is written, but hot and rending drugs which descend
and wrestle with the evil.'

'Very mightily they do so,' sighed the old lady.

The voice launched into an immense tale of misfortune and bankruptcy,
studded with plentiful petitions to the Government.  'But for my fate,
which overrules all, I had been now in Government employ.  I bear a
degree from the great school at Calcutta--whither, maybe, the son of
this House shall go.'

'He shall indeed.  If our neighbour's brat can in a few years be made
an F A' (First Arts--she used the English word, of which she had heard
so often), 'how much more shall children clever as some that I know
bear away prizes at rich Calcutta.'

'Never,' said the voice, 'have I seen such a child!  Born in an
auspicious hour, and--but for that colic which, alas!  turning into
black cholers, may carry him off like a pigeon--destined to many years,
he is enviable.'

'Hai mai!'  said the old lady.  'To praise children is inauspicious, or
I could listen to this talk.  But the back of the house is unguarded,
and even in this soft air men think themselves to be men, and women we
know ...  The child's father is away too, and I must be chowkedar
[watchman] in my old age.  Up!  Up!  Take up the palanquin. Let the
hakim and the young priest settle between them whether charms or
medicine most avail.  Ho!  worthless people, fetch tobacco for the
guests, and--round the homestead go I!'

The palanquin reeled off, followed by straggling torches and a horde of
dogs.  Twenty villages knew the Sahiba--her failings, her tongue, and
her large charity.  Twenty villages cheated her after immemorial
custom, but no man would have stolen or robbed within her jurisdiction
for any gift under heaven.  None the less, she made great parade of her
formal inspections, the riot of which could be heard half-way to
Mussoorie.

Kim relaxed, as one augur must when he meets another.  The hakim, still
squatting, slid over his hookah with a friendly foot, and Kim pulled at
the good weed.  The hangers-on expected grave professional debate, and
perhaps a little free doctoring.

'To discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece with teaching
the peacock to sing,' said the hakim.

'True courtesy,' Kim echoed, 'is very often inattention.'

These, be it understood, were company-manners, designed to impress.

'Hi!  I have an ulcer on my leg,' cried a scullion.  'Look at it!'

'Get hence!  Remove!'  said the hakim.  'Is it the habit of the place
to pester honoured guests?  Ye crowd in like buffaloes.'

'If the Sahiba knew--' Kim began.

'Ai!  Ai!  Come away.  They are meat for our mistress.  When her young
Shaitan's colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be suffered to--'

'The mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking the
money-lender's head.  Who speaks against her?'  The old servitor curled
his white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight.  'I am
responsible for the honour of this house.  Go!'  and he drove the
underlings before him.

Said the hakim, hardly more than shaping the words with his lips: 'How
do you do, Mister O'Hara?  I am jolly glad to see you again.'

Kim's hand clenched about the pipe-stem.  Anywhere on the open road,
perhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this quiet
backwater of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu.  It annoyed
him, too, that he had been hoodwinked.

'Ah ha!  I told you at Lucknow--resurgam--I shall rise again and you
shall not know me.  How much did you bet--eh?'

He chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he breathed uneasily.

'But why come here, Babuji?'

'Ah!  Thatt is the question, as Shakespeare hath it.  I come to
congratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi.
Oah!  I tell you we are all proud of you.  It was verree neat and
handy.  Our mutual friend, he is old friend of mine.  He has been in
some dam'-tight places.  Now he will be in some more.  He told me; I
tell Mr Lurgan; and he is pleased you graduate so nicely. All the
Department is pleased.'

For the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean pride (it can
be a deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praise--ensnaring
praise from an equal of work appreciated by fellow-workers.  Earth has
nothing on the same plane to compare with it. But, cried the Oriental
in him, Babus do not travel far to retail compliments.

'Tell thy tale, Babu,' he said authoritatively.

'Oah, it is nothing.  Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about
what our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old Creighton--' He
looked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.

'The Colonel Sahib,' the boy from St Xavier's corrected.  'Of course.
He found me at a loose string, and I had to go down to Chitor to find
that beastly letter.  I do not like the South--too much railway travel;
but I drew good travelling allowance.  Ha!  Ha!  I meet our mutual at
Delhi on the way back.  He lies quiett just now, and says
Saddhu-disguise suits him to the ground.  Well, there I hear what you
have done so well, so quickly, upon the instantaneous spur of the
moment.  I tell our mutual you take the bally bun, by Jove!  It was
splendid.  I come to tell you so.'

'Umm!'

The frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to her setting.
Some happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat
upon a drum.  Kim's next sentence was in the vernacular.

'How didst thou follow us?'

'Oah.  Thatt was nothing.  I know from our mutual friend you go to
Saharunpore.  So I come on.  Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons. I
buy myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really.  I go to
Akrola of the Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and talk
there.  All the common people know what you do.  I knew when the
hospitable old lady sent the dooli.  They have great recollections of
the old lama's visits here.  I know old ladies cannot keep their hands
from medicines.  So I am a doctor, and--you hear my talk?  I think it
is verree good.  My word, Mister O'Hara, they know about you and the
lama for fifty miles--the common people.  So I come.  Do you mind?'

'Babuji,' said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face, 'I am a
Sahib.'

'My dear Mister O'Hara--'

'And I hope to play the Great Game.'

'You are subordinate to me departmentally at present.'

'Then why talk like an ape in a tree?  Men do not come after one from
Simla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words.  I am
not a child.  Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg. Thou
art here--speaking not one word of truth in ten.  Why art thou here?
Give a straight answer.'

'That is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister O'Hara. You
should know a heap better at your time of life.'

'But I want to know,' said Kim, laughing.  'If it is the Game, I may
help.  How can I do anything if you bukh [babble] all round the shop?'

Hurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it gurgled again.

'Now I will speak vernacular.  You sit tight, Mister O'Hara ...  It
concerns the pedigree of a white stallion.'

'Still?  That was finished long ago.'

'When everyone is dead the Great Game is finished.  Not before. Listen
to me till the end.  There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war
three years ago, when thou wast given the stallion's pedigree by Mahbub
Ali.  Upon them, because of that news, and ere they were ready, fell
our Army.'

'Ay--eight thousand men with guns.  I remember that night.'

'But the war was not pushed.  That is the Government custom.  The
troops were recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings
were cowed; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes.
Hilas and Bunar--Rajahs with guns--undertook for a price to guard the
Passes against all coming from the North.  They protested both fear and
friendship.'  He broke off with a giggle into English:  'Of course, I
tell you this unoffeecially to elucidate political situation, Mister
O'Hara.  Offeecially, I am debarred from criticizing any action of
superiors.  Now I go on.--This pleased the Government, anxious to avoid
expense, and a bond was made for so many rupees a month that Hilas and
Bunar should guard the Passes as soon as the State's troops were
withdrawn.  At that time--it was after we two met--I, who had been
selling tea in Leh, became a clerk of accounts in the Army.  When the
troops were withdrawn, I was left behind to pay the coolies who made
new roads in the Hills. This road-making was part of the bond between
Bunar, Hilas, and the Government.'

'So?  And then?'

'I tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after summer,'
said Hurree Babu confidentially.  'I was afraid these Bunar men would
cut my throat every night for thee pay-chest.  My native sepoy-guard,
they laughed at me!  By Jove!  I was such a fearful man.  Nevar mind
thatt.  I go on colloquially ...  I send word many times that these two
Kings were sold to the North; and Mahbub Ali, who was yet farther
North, amply confirmed it.  Nothing was done.  Only my feet were
frozen, and a toe dropped off.  I sent word that the roads for which I
was paying money to the diggers were being made for the feet of
strangers and enemies.'

'For?'

'For the Russians.  The thing was an open jest among the coolies. Then
I was called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue. Mahbub came
South too.  See the end!  Over the Passes this year after
snow-melting'--he shivered afresh--'come two strangers under cover of
shooting wild goats.  They bear guns, but they bear also chains and
levels and compasses.'

'Oho!  The thing gets clearer.'

'They are well received by Hilas and Bunar.  They make great promises;
they speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts.  Up the valleys,
down the valleys go they, saying, "Here is a place to build a
breastwork; here can ye pitch a fort.  Here can ye hold the road
against an army"--the very roads for which I paid out the rupees
monthly.  The Government knows, but does nothing.  The three other
Kings, who were not paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner
of the bad faith of Bunar and Hilas.  When all the evil is done, look
you--when these two strangers with the levels and the compasses make
the Five Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes
tomorrow or the next day--Hill-people are all fools--comes the order to
me, Hurree Babu, "Go North and see what those strangers do."  I say to
Creighton Sahib, "This is not a lawsuit, that we go about to collect
evidence."'  Hurree returned to his English with a jerk:  "'By Jove," I
said, "why the dooce do you not issue demi-offeecial orders to some
brave man to poison them, for an example?  It is, if you permit the
observation, most reprehensible laxity on your part."  And Colonel
Creighton, he laughed at me!  It is all your beastly English pride.
You think no one dare conspire!  That is all tommy-rott.'

Kim smoked slowly, revolving the business, so far as he understood it,
in his quick mind.

'Then thou goest forth to follow the strangers?'

'No.  To meet them.  They are coming in to Simla to send down their
horns and heads to be dressed at Calcutta.  They are exclusively
sporting gentlemen, and they are allowed special faceelities by the
Government.  Of course, we always do that.  It is our British pride.'

'Then what is to fear from them?'

'By Jove, they are not black people.  I can do all sorts of things with
black people, of course.  They are Russians, and highly unscrupulous
people.  I--I do not want to consort with them without a witness.'

'Will they kill thee?'

'Oah, thatt is nothing.  I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust,
to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.
But--but they may beat me.'

'Why?'

Hurree Babu snapped his fingers with irritation.  'Of course I shall
affeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as perhaps
interpreter, or person mentally impotent and hungree, or some such
thing.  And then I must pick up what I can, I suppose.  That is as easy
for me as playing Mister Doctor to the old lady.  Onlee--onlee--you
see, Mister O'Hara, I am unfortunately Asiatic, which is serious
detriment in some respects.  And all-so I am Bengali--a fearful man.'

'God made the Hare and the Bengali.  What shame?'  said Kim, quoting
the proverb.

'It was process of Evolution, I think, from Primal Necessity, but the
fact remains in all the cui bono.  I am, oh, awfully fearful!--I
remember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to Lhassa.
(No, I have never reached to Lhassa.) I sat down and cried, Mister
O'Hara, anticipating Chinese tortures.  I do not suppose these two
gentlemen will torture me, but I like to provide for possible
contingency with European assistance in emergency.'  He coughed and
spat out the cardamoms.  'It is purely unoffeecial indent, to which you
can say "No, Babu".  If you have no pressing engagement with your old
man--perhaps you might divert him; perhaps I can seduce his fancies--I
should like you to keep in Departmental touch with me till I find those
sporting coves.  I have great opeenion of you since I met my friend at
Delhi.  And also I will embody your name in my offeecial report when
matter is finally adjudicated.  It will be a great feather in your cap.
That is why I come really.'

'Humph!  The end of the tale, I think, is true; but what of the
fore-part?'

'About the Five Kings?  Oah!  there is ever so much truth in it.  A
lots more than you would suppose,' said Hurree earnestly.  'You
come--eh?  I go from here straight into the Doon.  It is verree verdant
and painted meads.  I shall go to Mussoorie to good old Munsoorie
Pahar, as the gentlemen and ladies say.  Then by Rampur into Chini.
That is the only way they can come.  I do not like waiting in the cold,
but we must wait for them.  I want to walk with them to Simla. You see,
one Russian is a Frenchman, and I know my French pretty well.  I have
friends in Chandernagore.'

'He would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again,' said Kim
meditatively.  'All his speech these ten days past has been of little
else.  If we go together--'

'Oah!  We can be quite strangers on the road, if your lama prefers.  I
shall just be four or five miles ahead.  There is no hurry for
Hurree--that is an Europe pun, ha!  ha!--and you come after.  There is
plenty of time; they will plot and survey and map, of course.  I shall
go tomorrow, and you the next day, if you choose.  Eh?  You go think on
it till morning.  By Jove, it is near morning now.'  He yawned
ponderously, and with never a civil word lumbered off to his
sleeping-place.  But Kim slept little, and his thoughts ran in
Hindustani:

'Well is the Game called great!  I was four days a scullion at Quetta,
waiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole.  And that was part
of the Great Game!  From the South--God knows how far--came up the
Mahratta, playing the Great Game in fear of his life. Now I shall go
far and far into the North playing the Great Game. Truly, it runs like
a shuttle throughout all Hind.  And my share and my joy'--he smiled to
the darkness--'I owe to the lama here.  Also to Mahbub Ali--also to
Creighton Sahib, but chiefly to the Holy One. He is right--a great and
a wonderful world--and I am Kim--Kim--Kim--alone--one person--in the
middle of it all.  But I will see these strangers with their levels and
chains...'

'What was the upshot of last night's babble?'  said the lama, after his
orisons.

'There came a strolling seller of drugs--a hanger-on of the Sahiba's.
Him I abolished by arguments and prayers, proving that our charms are
worthier than his coloured waters.'

'Alas, my charms!  Is the virtuous woman still bent upon a new one?'

'Very strictly.'

'Then it must be written, or she will deafen me with her clamour.' He
fumbled at his pencase.

'In the Plains,' said Kim, 'are always too many people.  In the Hills,
as I understand, there are fewer.'

'Oh!  the Hills, and the snows upon the Hills.'  The lami tore off a
tiny square of paper fit to go in an amulet.  'But what dost thou know
of the Hills?'

'They are very close.'  Kim thrust open the door and looked at the
long, peaceful line of the Himalayas flushed in morning-gold. 'Except
in the dress of a Sahib, I have never set foot among them.'

The lama snuffed the wind wistfully.

'If we go North,'--Kim put the question to the waking sunrise--'would
not much mid-day heat be avoided by walking among the lower hills at
least?  ...  Is the charm made, Holy One?'

'I have written the names of seven silly devils--not one of whom is
worth a grain of dust in the eye.  Thus do foolish women drag us from
the Way!'

Hurree Babu came out from behind the dovecote washing his teeth with
ostentatious ritual.  Full-fleshed, heavy-haunched, bull-necked, and
deep-voiced, he did not look like 'a fearful man'.  Kim signed almost
imperceptibly that matters were in good train, and when the morning
toilet was over, Hurree Babu, in flowery speech, came to do honour to
the lama.  They ate, of course, apart, and afterwards the old lady,
more or less veiled behind a window, returned to the vital business of
green-mango colics in the young.  The lama's knowledge of medicine was,
of course, sympathetic only.  He believed that the dung of a black
horse, mixed with sulphur, and carried in a snake-skin, was a sound
remedy for cholera; but the symbolism interested him far more than the
science.  Hurree Babu deferred to these views with enchanting
politeness, so that the lama called him a courteous physician.  Hurree
Babu replied that he was no more than an inexpert dabbler in the
mysteries; but at least--he thanked the Gods therefore--he knew when he
sat in the presence of a master.  He himself had been taught by the
Sahibs, who do not consider expense, in the lordly halls of Calcutta;
but, as he was ever first to acknowledge, there lay a wisdom behind
earthly wisdom--the high and lonely lore of meditation.  Kim looked on
with envy.  The Hurree Babu of his knowledge--oily, effusive, and
nervous--was gone; gone, too, was the brazen drug-vendor of overnight.
There remained--polished, polite, attentive--a sober, learned son of
experience and adversity, gathering wisdom from the lama's lips.  The
old lady confided to Kim that these rare levels were beyond her.  She
liked charms with plenty of ink that one could wash off in water,
swallow, and be done with.  Else what was the use of the Gods?  She
liked men and women, and she spoke of them--of kinglets she had known
in the past; of her own youth and beauty; of the depredations of
leopards and the eccentricities of love Asiatic; of the incidence of
taxation, rack-renting, funeral ceremonies, her son-in-law (this by
allusion, easy to be followed), the care of the young, and the age's
lack of decency.  And Kim, as interested in the life of this world as
she soon to leave it, squatted with his feet under the hem of his robe,
drinking all in, while the lama demolished one after another every
theory of body-curing put forward by Hurree Babu.

At noon the Babu strapped up his brass-bound drug-box, took his
patent-leather shoes of ceremony in one hand, a gay blue-and-white
umbrella in the other, and set off northwards to the Doon, where, he
said, he was in demand among the lesser kings of those parts.

'We will go in the cool of the evening, chela,' said the lama.  'That
doctor, learned in physic and courtesy, affirms that the people among
these lower hills are devout, generous, and much in need of a teacher.
In a very short time--so says the hakim--we come to cool air and the
smell of pines.'

'Ye go to the Hills?  And by Kulu road?  Oh, thrice happy!'  shrilled
the old lady.  'But that I am a little pressed with the care of the
homestead I would take palanquin ...  but that would be shameless, and
my reputation would be cracked.  Ho!  Ho!  I know the road--every march
of the road I know.  Ye will find charity throughout--it is not denied
to the well-looking.  I will give orders for provision.  A servant to
set you forth upon your journey?  No ...  Then I will at least cook ye
good food.'

'What a woman is the Sahiba!'  said the white-bearded Oorya, when a
tumult rose by the kitchen quarters.  'She has never forgotten a
friend:  she has never forgotten an enemy in all her years.  And her
cookery--wah!'  He rubbed his slim stomach.

There were cakes, there were sweetmeats, there was cold fowl stewed to
rags with rice and prunes--enough to burden Kim like a mule.

'I am old and useless,' she said.  'None now love me--and none
respect--but there are few to compare with me when I call on the Gods
and squat to my cooking-pots.  Come again, O people of good will.  Holy
One and disciple, come again.  The room is always prepared; the welcome
is always ready ...  See the women do not follow thy chela too openly.
I know the women of Kulu.  Take heed, chela, lest he run away when he
smells his Hills again ...  Hai!  Do not tilt the rice-bag upside down
...  Bless the household, Holy One, and forgive thy servant her
stupidities.'

She wiped her red old eyes on a corner of her veil, and clucked
throatily.

'Women talk,' said the lama at last, 'but that is a woman's infirmity.
I gave her a charm.  She is upon the Wheel and wholly given over to the
shows of this life, but none the less, chela, she is virtuous, kindly,
hospitable--of a whole and zealous heart.  Who shall say she does not
acquire merit?'

'Not I, Holy One,' said Kim, reslinging the bountiful provision on his
shoulders.  'In my mind--behind my eyes--I have tried to picture such
an one altogether freed from the Wheel--desiring nothing, causing
nothing--a nun, as it were.'

'And, O imp?'  The lama almost laughed aloud.

'I cannot make the picture.'

'Nor I. But there are many, many millions of lives before her.  She
will get wisdom a little, it may be, in each one.'

'And will she forget how to make stews with saffron upon that road?'

'Thy mind is set on things unworthy.  But she has skill.  I am
refreshed all over.  When we reach the lower hills I shall be yet
stronger.  The hakim spoke truly to me this morn when he said a breath
from the snows blows away twenty years from the life of a man.  We will
go up into the Hills--the high hills--up to the sound of snow-waters
and the sound of the trees--for a little while.  The hakim said that at
any time we may return to the Plains, for we do no more than skirt the
pleasant places.  The hakim is full of learning; but he is in no way
proud.  I spoke to him--when thou wast talking to the Sahiba--of a
certain dizziness that lays hold upon the back of my neck in the night,
and he said it rose from excessive heat--to be cured by cool air.  Upon
consideration, I marvelled that I had not thought of such a simple
remedy.'

'Didst thou tell him of thy Search?'  said Kim, a little jealously. He
preferred to sway the lama by his own speech--not through the wiles of
Hurree Babu.

'Assuredly.  I told him of my dream, and of the manner by which I had
acquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom.'

'Thou didst not say I was a Sahib?'

'What need?  I have told thee many times we be but two souls seeking
escape.  He said--and he is just herein--that the River of Healing will
break forth even as I dreamed--at my feet, if need be.  Having found
the Way, seest thou, that shall free me from the Wheel, need I trouble
to find a way about the mere fields of earth--which are illusion?  That
were senseless.  I have my dreams, night upon night repeated; I have
Jataka; and I have thee, Friend of all the World. It was written in thy
horoscope that a Red Bull on a green field--I have not
forgotten--should bring thee to honour.  Who but I saw that prophecy
accomplished?  Indeed, I was the instrument.  Thou shalt find me my
River, being in return the instrument.  The Search is sure!'

He set his ivory-yellow face, serene and untroubled, towards the
beckoning Hills; his shadow shouldering far before him in the dust.




Chapter 13


  Who hath desired the Sea--the immense and contemptuous surges?
  The shudder, the stumble, the swerve ere the star-stabbing bowsprit
      merges--
  The orderly clouds of the Trades and the ridged roaring
      sapphire thereunder--
  Unheralded cliff-lurking flaws and the head-sails' low-volleying
      thunder?
  His Sea in no wonder the same--his Sea and the same in each wonder--
  His Sea that his being fulfils?
  So and no otherwise--so and no otherwise hill-men desire their hills!

  The Sea and the Hills.



'Who goes to the hills goes to his mother.'

They had crossed the Siwaliks and the half-tropical Doon, left
Mussoorie behind them, and headed north along the narrow hill-roads.
Day after day they struck deeper into the huddled mountains, and day
after day Kim watched the lama return to a man's strength.  Among the
terraces of the Doon he had leaned on the boy's shoulder, ready to
profit by wayside halts.  Under the great ramp to Mussoorie he drew
himself together as an old hunter faces a well-remembered bank, and
where he should have sunk exhausted swung his long draperies about him,
drew a deep double-lungful of the diamond air, and walked as only a
hillman can.  Kim, plains-bred and plains-fed, sweated and panted
astonished.  'This is my country,' said the lama.  'Beside Such-zen,
this is flatter than a rice-field'; and with steady, driving strokes
from the loins he strode upwards.  But it was on the steep downhill
marches, three thousand feet in three hours, that he went utterly away
from Kim, whose back ached with holding back, and whose big toe was
nigh cut off by his grass sandal-string.  Through the speckled shadow
of the great deodar-forests; through oak feathered and plumed with
ferns; birch, ilex, rhododendron, and pine, out on to the bare
hillsides' slippery sunburnt grass, and back into the woodlands' coolth
again, till oak gave way to bamboo and palm of the valley, the lama
swung untiring.

Glancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and the
faint, thin line of the road whereby they had come, he would lay out,
with a hillman's generous breadth of vision, fresh marches for the
morrow; or, halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that gave on
Spiti and Kulu, would stretch out his hands yearningly towards the high
snows of the horizon.  In the dawns they flared windy-red above stark
blue, as Kedarnath and Badrinath--kings of that wilderness--took the
first sunlight.  All day long they lay like molten silver under the
sun, and at evening put on their jewels again.  At first they breathed
temperately upon the travellers, winds good to meet when one crawled
over some gigantic hog's-back; but in a few days, at a height of nine
or ten thousand feet, those breezes bit; and Kim kindly allowed a
village of hillmen to acquire merit by giving him a rough blanket-coat.
The lama was mildly surprised that anyone should object to the
knife-edged breezes which had cut the years off his shoulders.

'These are but the lower hills, chela.  There is no cold till we come
to the true Hills.'

'Air and water are good, and the people are devout enough, but the food
is very bad,' Kim growled; 'and we walk as though we were mad--or
English.  It freezes at night, too.'

'A little, maybe; but only enough to make old bones rejoice in the sun.
We must not always delight in soft beds and rich food.'

'We might at least keep to the road.'

Kim had all a plainsman's affection for the well-trodden track, not six
feet wide, that snaked among the mountains; but the lama, being
Tibetan, could not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the rims of
gravel-strewn slopes.  As he explained to his limping disciple, a man
bred among mountains can prophesy the course of a mountain-road, and
though low-lying clouds might be a hindrance to a short-cutting
stranger, they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful man.  Thus,
after long hours of what would be reckoned very fair mountaineering in
civilized countries, they would pant over a saddle-back, sidle past a
few landslips, and drop through forest at an angle of forty-five onto
the road again.  Along their track lay the villages of the
hillfolk--mud and earth huts, timbers now and then rudely carved with
an axe--clinging like swallows' nests against the steeps, huddled on
tiny flats half-way down a three-thousand-foot glissade; jammed into a
corner between cliffs that funnelled and focused every wandering blast;
or, for the sake of summer pasture, cowering down on a neck that in
winter would be ten feet deep in snow.  And the people--the sallow,
greasy, duffle-clad people, with short bare legs and faces almost
Esquimaux--would flock out and adore.  The Plains--kindly and
gentle--had treated the lama as a holy man among holy men.  But the
Hills worshipped him as one in the confidence of all their devils.
Theirs was an almost obliterated Buddhism, overlaid with a
nature-worship fantastic as their own landscapes, elaborate as the
terracing of their tiny fields; but they recognized the big hat, the
clicking rosary, and the rare Chinese texts for great authority; and
they respected the man beneath the hat.

'We saw thee come down over the black Breasts of Eua,' said a Betah who
gave them cheese, sour milk, and stone-hard bread one evening. 'We do
not use that often--except when calving cows stray in summer.  There is
a sudden wind among those stones that casts men down on the stillest
day.  But what should such folk care for the Devil of Eua!'

Then did Kim, aching in every fibre, dizzy with looking down, footsore
with cramping desperate toes into inadequate crannies, take joy in the
day's march--such joy as a boy of St Xavier's who had won the
quarter-mile on the flat might take in the praises of his friends.  The
hills sweated the ghi and sugar suet off his bones; the dry air, taken
sobbingly at the head of cruel passes, firmed and built out his upper
ribs; and the tilted levels put new hard muscles into calf and thigh.

They meditated often on the Wheel of Life--the more so since, as the
lama said, they were freed from its visible temptations.  Except the
grey eagle and an occasional far-seen bear grubbing and rooting on the
hillside; a vision of a furious painted leopard met at dawn in a still
valley devouring a goat; and now and again a bright-coloured bird, they
were alone with the winds and the grass singing under the wind.  The
women of the smoky huts over whose roofs the two walked as they
descended the mountains, were unlovely and unclean, wives of many
husbands, and afflicted with goitre.  The men were woodcutters when
they were not farmers--meek, and of an incredible simplicity.  But that
suitable discourse might not fail, Fate sent them, overtaking and
overtaken upon the road, the courteous Dacca physician, who paid for
his food in ointments good for goitre and counsels that restore peace
between men and women.  He seemed to know these hills as well as he
knew the hill dialects, and gave the lama the lie of the land towards
Ladakh and Tibet.  He said they could return to the Plains at any
moment.  Meantime, for such as loved mountains, yonder road might
amuse.  This was not all revealed in a breath, but at evening
encounters on the stone threshing-floors, when, patients disposed of,
the doctor would smoke and the lama snuff, while Kim watched the wee
cows grazing on the housetops, or threw his soul after his eyes across
the deep blue gulfs between range and range.  And there were talks
apart in the dark woods, when the doctor would seek herbs, and Kim, as
budding physician, must accompany him.

'You see, Mister O'Hara, I do not know what the deuce-an' all I shall
do when I find our sporting friends; but if you will kindly keep within
sight of my umbrella, which is fine fixed point for cadastral survey, I
shall feel much better.'

Kim looked out across the jungle of peaks.  'This is not my country,
hakim.  Easier, I think, to find one louse in a bear-skin.'

'Oah, thatt is my strong points.  There is no hurry for Hurree.  They
were at Leh not so long ago.  They said they had come down from the
Karakorum with their heads and horns and all.  I am onlee afraid they
will have sent back all their letters and compromising things from Leh
into Russian territoree.  Of course they will walk away as far to the
East as possible--just to show that they were never among the Western
States.  You do not know the Hills?'  He scratched with a twig on the
earth.  'Look!  They should have come in by Srinagar or Abbottabad.
Thatt is their short road--down the river by Bunji and Astor.  But they
have made mischief in the West.  So'--he drew a furrow from left to
right--'they march and they march away East to Leh (ah!  it is cold
there), and down the Indus to Hanle (I know that road), and then down,
you see, to Bushahr and Chini valley.  That is ascertained by process
of elimination, and also by asking questions from people that I cure so
well.  Our friends have been a long time playing about and producing
impressions.  So they are well known from far off.  You will see me
catch them somewhere in Chini valley. Please keep your eye on the
umbrella.'

It nodded like a wind-blown harebell down the valleys and round the
mountain sides, and in due time the lama and Kim, who steered by
compass, would overhaul it, vending ointments and powders at eventide.
'We came by such and such a way!'  The lama would throw a careless
finger backward at the ridges, and the umbrella would expend itself in
compliments.

They crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama, mildly
chaffing Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian camel--the
snow-bred, shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai. They
dipped across beds of light snow and snow-powdered shale, where they
took refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep,
each laden with a bag of borax.  They came out upon grassy shoulders
still snow-speckled, and through forest, to grass anew.  For all their
marchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were not impressed; and it was only
after days of travel that Kim, uplifted upon some insignificant
ten-thousand-foot hummock, could see that a shoulder-knot or horn of
the two great lords had--ever so slightly--changed outline.

At last they entered a world within a world--a valley of leagues where
the high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the
knees of the mountains.  Here one day's march carried them no farther,
it seemed, than a dreamer's clogged pace bears him in a nightmare.
They skirted a shoulder painfully for hours, and, behold, it was but an
outlying boss in an outlying buttress of the main pile!  A rounded
meadow revealed itself, when they had reached it, for a vast tableland
running far into the valley.  Three days later, it was a dim fold in
the earth to southward.

'Surely the Gods live here!'  said Kim, beaten down by the silence and
the appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows after rain.
'This is no place for men!'

'Long and long ago,' said the lama, as to himself, 'it was asked of the
Lord whether the world were everlasting.  On this the Excellent One
returned no answer ...  When I was in Ceylon, a wise Seeker confirmed
that from the gospel which is written in Pali.  Certainly, since we
know the way to Freedom, the question were unprofitable, but--look, and
know illusion, chela!  These--are the true Hills! They are like my
hills by Suchzen.  Never were such hills!'

Above them, still enormously above them, earth towered away towards the
snow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of miles, ruled as
with a ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped.  Above that, in
scarps and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to fight their heads above
the white smother.  Above these again, changeless since the world's
beginning, but changing to every mood of sun and cloud, lay out the
eternal snow.  They could see blots and blurs on its face where storm
and wandering wullie-wa got up to dance.  Below them, as they stood,
the forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for mile upon mile; below
the forest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and steep
grazing-grounds.  Below the village they knew, though a thunderstorm
worried and growled there for the moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen
hundred feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are
the mothers of young Sutluj.

As usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far from the
main route along which Hurree Babu, that 'fearful man', had bucketed
three days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten
would have given full right of way.  Hurree was no game-shot--the snick
of a trigger made him change colour--but, as he himself would have
said, he was 'fairly effeecient stalker', and he had raked the huge
valley with a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose.  Moreover, the
white of worn canvas tents against green carries far.  Hurree Babu had
seen all he wanted to see when he sat on the threshing-floor of
Ziglaur, twenty miles away as the eagle flies, and forty by road--that
is to say, two small dots which one day were just below the snow-line,
and the next had moved downward perhaps six inches on the hillside.
Once cleaned out and set to the work, his fat bare legs could cover a
surprising amount of ground, and this was the reason why, while Kim and
the lama lay in a leaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be
over-past, an oily, wet, but always smiling Bengali, talking the best
of English with the vilest of phrases, was ingratiating himself with
two sodden and rather rheumatic foreigners.  He had arrived, revolving
many wild schemes, on the heels of a thunderstorm which had split a
pine over against their camp, and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly
impressed baggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel
that with one accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed.  They
were subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as is the
custom, for his private gain; and, to add to their personal distresses,
the strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles.  The most
of them knew rifles and Sahibs of old:  they were trackers and
shikarris of the Northern valleys, keen after bear and wild goat; but
they had never been thus treated in their lives.  So the forest took
them to her bosom, and, for all oaths and clamour, refused to restore.
There was no need to feign madness or--the Babu had thought of another
means of securing a welcome.  He wrung out his wet clothes, slipped on
his patent-leather shoes, opened the blue-and-white umbrella, and with
mincing gait and a heart beating against his tonsils appeared as 'agent
for His Royal Highness, the Rajah of Rampur, gentlemen.  What can I do
for you, please?'

The gentlemen were delighted.  One was visibly French, the other
Russian, but they spoke English not much inferior to the Babu's. They
begged his kind offices.  Their native servants had gone sick at Leh.
They had hurried on because they were anxious to bring the spoils of
the chase to Simla ere the skins grew moth-eaten.  They bore a general
letter of introduction (the Babu salaamed to it orientally) to all
Government officials.  No, they had not met any other shooting-parties
en route.  They did for themselves.  They had plenty of supplies.  They
only wished to push on as soon as might be. At this he waylaid a
cowering hillman among the trees, and after three minutes' talk and a
little silver (one cannot be economical upon State service, though
Hurree's heart bled at the waste) the eleven coolies and the three
hangers-on reappeared.  At least the Babu would be a witness to their
oppression.

'My royal master, he will be much annoyed, but these people are onlee
common people and grossly ignorant.  If your honours will kindly
overlook unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased.  In a little
while rain will stop and we can then proceed.  You have been shooting,
eh?  That is fine performance!'

He skipped nimbly from one kilta to the next, making pretence to adjust
each conical basket.  The Englishman is not, as a rule, familiar with
the Asiatic, but he would not strike across the wrist a kindly Babu who
had accidentally upset a kilta with a red oilskin top.  On the other
hand, he would not press drink upon a Babu were he never so friendly,
nor would he invite him to meat.  The strangers did all these things,
and asked many questions--about women mostly--to which Hurree returned
gay and unstudied answers. They gave him a glass of whitish fluid like
to gin, and then more; and in a little time his gravity departed from
him.  He became thickly treasonous, and spoke in terms of sweeping
indecency of a Government which had forced upon him a white man's
education and neglected to supply him with a white man's salary.  He
babbled tales of oppression and wrong till the tears ran down his
cheeks for the miseries of his land.  Then he staggered off, singing
love-songs of Lower Bengal, and collapsed upon a wet tree-trunk.  Never
was so unfortunate a product of English rule in India more unhappily
thrust upon aliens.

'They are all just of that pattern,' said one sportsman to the other in
French.  'When we get into India proper thou wilt see.  I should like
to visit his Rajah.  One might speak the good word there.  It is
possible that he has heard of us and wishes to signify his good-will.'

'We have not time.  We must get into Simla as soon as may be,' his
companion replied.  'For my own part, I wish our reports had been sent
back from Hilas, or even Leh.'

'The English post is better and safer.  Remember we are given all
facilities--and Name of God!--they give them to us too!  Is it
unbelievable stupidity?'

'It is pride--pride that deserves and will receive punishment.'

'Yes!  To fight a fellow-Continental in our game is something.  There
is a risk attached, but these people--bah!  It is too easy.'

'Pride--all pride, my friend.'

'Now what the deuce is good of Chandernagore being so close to Calcutta
and all,' said Hurree, snoring open-mouthed on the sodden moss, 'if I
cannot understand their French?  They talk so particularly fast!  It
would have been much better to cut their beastly throats.'

When he presented himself again he was racked with a
headache--penitent, and volubly afraid that in his drunkenness he might
have been indiscreet.  He loved the British Government--it was the
source of all prosperity and honour, and his master at Rampur held the
very same opinion.  Upon this the men began to deride him and to quote
past words, till step by step, with deprecating smirks, oily grins, and
leers of infinite cunning, the poor Babu was beaten out of his defences
and forced to speak--truth.  When Lurgan was told the tale later, he
mourned aloud that he could not have been in the place of the stubborn,
inattentive coolies, who with grass mats over their heads and the
raindrops puddling in their footprints, waited on the weather.  All the
Sahibs of their acquaintance--rough-clad men joyously returning year
after year to their chosen gullies--had servants and cooks and
orderlies, very often hillmen.  These Sahibs travelled without any
retinue.  Therefore they were poor Sahibs, and ignorant; for no Sahib
in his senses would follow a Bengali's advice.  But the Bengali,
appearing from somewhere, had given them money, and could make shift
with their dialect.  Used to comprehensive ill-treatment from their own
colour, they suspected a trap somewhere, and stood by to run if
occasion offered.

Then through the new-washed air, steaming with delicious earth-smells,
the Babu led the way down the slopes--walking ahead of the coolies in
pride; walking behind the foreigners in humility.  His thoughts were
many and various.  The least of them would have interested his
companions beyond words.  But he was an agreeable guide, ever keen to
point out the beauties of his royal master's domain.  He peopled the
hills with anything thev had a mind to slay--thar, ibex, or markhor,
and bear by Elisha's allowance.  He discoursed of botany and ethnology
with unimpeachable inaccuracy, and his store of local legends--he had
been a trusted agent of the State for fifteen years, remember--was
inexhaustible.

'Decidedly this fellow is an original,' said the taller of the two
foreigners.  'He is like the nightmare of a Viennese courier.'

'He represents in little India in transition--the monstrous hybridism
of East and West,' the Russian replied.  'It is we who can deal with
Orientals.'

'He has lost his own country and has not acquired any other.  But he
has a most complete hatred of his conquerors.  Listen.  He confided to
me last night,' said the other.

Under the striped umbrella Hurree Babu was straining ear and brain to
follow the quick-poured French, and keeping both eyes on a kilta full
of maps and documents--an extra-large one with a double red oil-skin
cover.  He did not wish to steal anything.  He only desired to know
what to steal, and, incidentally, how to get away when he had stolen
it.  He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that
there remained some valuables to steal.

On the second day the road rose steeply to a grass spur above the
forest; and it was here, about sunset, that they came across an aged
lama--but they called him a bonze--sitting cross-legged above a
mysterious chart held down by stones, which he was explaining to a
young man, evidently a neophyte, of singular, though unwashen, beauty.
The striped umbrella had been sighted half a march away, and Kim had
suggested a halt till it came up to them.

'Ha!'  said Hurree Babu, resourceful as Puss-in-Boots.  'That is
eminent local holy man.  Probably subject of my royal master.'

'What is he doing?  It is very curious.'

'He is expounding holy picture--all hand-worked.'

The two men stood bareheaded in the wash of the afternoon sunlight low
across the gold-coloured grass.  The sullen coolies, glad of the check,
halted and slid down their loads.

'Look!'  said the Frenchman.  'It is like a picture for the birth of a
religion--the first teacher and the first disciple.  Is he a Buddhist?'

'Of some debased kind,' the other answered.  'There are no true
Buddhists among the Hills.  But look at the folds of the drapery. Look
at his eyes--how insolent!  Why does this make one feel that we are so
young a people?'  The speaker struck passionately at a tall weed.  'We
have nowhere left our mark yet.  Nowhere!  That, do you understand, is
what disquiets me.'  He scowled at the placid face, and the monumental
calm of the pose.

'Have patience.  We shall make your mark together--we and you young
people.  Meantime, draw his picture.'

The Babu advanced loftily; his back out of all keeping with his
deferential speech, or his wink towards Kim.

'Holy One, these be Sahibs.  My medicines cured one of a flux, and I go
into Simla to oversee his recovery.  They wish to see thy picture--'

'To heal the sick is always good.  This is the Wheel of Life,' said the
lama, 'the same I showed thee in the hut at Ziglaur when the rain fell.'

'And to hear thee expound it.'

The lama's eyes lighted at the prospect of new listeners.  'To expound
the Most Excellent Way is good.  Have they any knowledge of Hindi, such
as had the Keeper of Images?'

'A little, maybe.'

Hereat, simply as a child engrossed with a new game, the lama threw
back his head and began the full-throated invocation of the Doctor of
Divinity ere he opens the full doctrine.  The strangers leaned on their
alpenstocks and listened.  Kim, squatting humbly, watched the red
sunlight on their faces, and the blend and parting of their long
shadows.  They wore un-English leggings and curious girt-in belts that
reminded him hazily of the pictures in a book in St Xavier's library
"The Adventures of a Young Naturalist in Mexico" was its name.  Yes,
they looked very like the wonderful M. Sumichrast of that tale, and
very unlike the 'highly unscrupulous folk' of Hurree Babu's imagining.
The coolies, earth-coloured and mute, crouched reverently some twenty
or thirty yards away, and the Babu, the slack of his thin gear snapping
like a marking-flag in the chill breeze, stood by with an air of happy
proprietorship.

'These are the men,' Hurree whispered, as the ritual went on and the
two whites followed the grass-blade sweeping from Hell to Heaven and
back again.  'All their books are in the large kilta with the reddish
top--books and reports and maps--and I have seen a King's letter that
either Hilas or Bunar has written.  They guard it most carefully.  They
have sent nothing back from Hilas or Leh.  That is sure.'

'Who is with them?'

'Only the beegar-coolies.  They have no servants.  They are so close
they cook their own food.'

'But what am I to do?'

'Wait and see.  Only if any chance comes to me thou wilt know where to
seek for the papers.'

'This were better in Mahbub Ali's hands than a Bengali's,' said Kim
scornfully.

'There are more ways of getting to a sweetheart than butting down a
wall.'

'See here the Hell appointed for avarice and greed.  Flanked upon the
one side by Desire and on the other by Weariness.'  The lama warmed to
his work, and one of the strangers sketched him in the quick-fading
light.

'That is enough,' the man said at last brusquely.  'I cannot understand
him, but I want that picture.  He is a better artist than I. Ask him if
he will sell it.'

'He says "No, sar,"' the Babu replied.  The lama, of course, would no
more have parted with his chart to a casual wayfarer than an archbishop
would pawn the holy vessels of his cathedral.  All Tibet is full of
cheap reproductions of the Wheel; but the lama was an artist, as well
as a wealthy Abbot in his own place.

'Perhaps in three days, or four, or ten, if I perceive that the Sahib
is a Seeker and of good understanding, I may myself draw him another.
But this was used for the initiation of a novice.  Tell him so, hakim.'

'He wishes it now--for money.'

The lama shook his head slowly and began to fold up the Wheel.  The
Russian, on his side, saw no more than an unclean old man haggling over
a dirty piece of paper.  He drew out a handful of rupees, and snatched
half-jestingly at the chart, which tore in the lama's grip. A low
murmur of horror went up from the coolies--some of whom were Spiti men
and, by their lights, good Buddhists.  The lama rose at the insult; his
hand went to the heavy iron pencase that is the priest's weapon, and
the Babu danced in agony.

'Now you see--you see why I wanted witnesses.  They are highly
unscrupulous people.  Oh, sar!  sar!  You must not hit holyman!'

'Chela!  He has defiled the Written Word!'

It was too late.  Before Kim could ward him off, the Russian struck the
old man full on the face.  Next instant he was rolling over and over
downhill with Kim at his throat.  The blow had waked every unknown
Irish devil in the boy's blood, and the sudden fall of his enemy did
the rest.  The lama dropped to his knees, half-stunned; the coolies
under their loads fled up the hill as fast as plainsmen run aross the
level.  They had seen sacrilege unspeakable, and it behoved them to get
away before the Gods and devils of the hills took vengeance.  The
Frenchman ran towards the lama, fumbling at his revolver with some
notion of making him a hostage for his companion. A shower of cutting
stones--hillmen are very straight shots--drove him away, and a coolie
from Ao-chung snatched the lama into the stampede.  All came about as
swiftly as the sudden mountain-darkness.

'They have taken the baggage and all the guns,' yelled the Frenchman,
firing blindly into the twilight.

'All right, sar!  All right!  Don't shoot.  I go to rescue,' and
Hurree, pounding down the slope, cast himself bodily upon the delighted
and astonished Kim, who was banging his breathless foe's head against a
boulder.

'Go back to the coolies,' whispered the Babu in his ear.  'They have
the baggage.  The papers are in the kilta with the red top, but look
through all.  Take their papers, and specially the murasla [King's
letter].  Go!  The other man comes!'

Kim tore uphill.  A revolver-bullet rang on a rock by his side, and he
cowered partridge-wise.

'If you shoot,' shouted Hurree, 'they will descend and annihilate us.
I have rescued the gentleman, sar.  This is particularly dangerous.'

'By Jove!'  Kim was thinking hard in English.  'This is dam'-tight
place, but I think it is self-defence.'  He felt in his bosom for
Mahbub's gift, and uncertainly--save for a few practice shots in the
Bikanir desert, he had never used the little gun--pulled the trigger.

'What did I say, sar!'  The Babu seemed to be in tears.  'Come down
here and assist to resuscitate.  We are all up a tree, I tell you.'

The shots ceased.  There was a sound of stumbling feet, and Kim hurried
upward through the gloom, swearing like a cat--or a country-bred.

'Did they wound thee, chela?'  called the lama above him.

'No.  And thou?'  He dived into a clump of stunted firs.

'Unhurt.  Come away.  We go with these folk to Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.'

'But not before we have done justice,' a voice cried.  'I have got the
Sahibs' guns--all four.  Let us go down.'

'He struck the Holy One--we saw it!  Our cattle will be barren--our
wives will cease to bear!  The snows will slide upon us as we go
home...  Atop of all other oppression too!'

The little fir-clump filled with clamouring coolies--panic-stricken,
and in their terror capable of anything.  The man from Ao-chung clicked
the breech-bolt of his gun impatiently, and made as to go downhill.

'Wait a little, Holy One; they cannot go far.  Wait till I return,'
said he.

'It is this person who has suffered wrong,' said the lama, his hand
over his brow.

'For that very reason,' was the reply.

'If this person overlooks it, your hands are clean.  Moreover, ye
acquire merit by obedience.'

'Wait, and we will all go to Shamlegh together,' the man insisted.

For a moment, for just so long as it needs to stuff a cartridge into a
breech-loader, the lama hesitated.  Then he rose to his feet, and laid
a finger on the man's shoulder.

'Hast thou heard?  I say there shall be no killing--I who was Abbot of
Such-zen.  Is it any lust of thine to be re-born as a rat, or a snake
under the eaves--a worm in the belly of the most mean beast? Is it thy
wish to--'

The man from Ao-chung fell to his knees, for the voice boomed like a
Tibetan devil-gong.

'Ai!  ai!'  cried the Spiti men.  'Do not curse us--do not curse him.
It was but his zeal, Holy One!  ... Put down the rifle, fool!'

'Anger on anger!  Evil on evil!  There will be no killing.  Let the
priest-beaters go in bondage to their own acts.  Just and sure is the
Wheel, swerving not a hair!  They will be born many times--in torment.'
His head drooped, and he leaned heavily on Kim's shoulder.

'I have come near to great evil, chela,' he whispered in that dead hush
under the pines.  'I was tempted to loose the bullet; and truly, in
Tibet there would have been a heavy and a slow death for them ... He
struck me across the face ...  upon the flesh ...'  He slid to the
ground, breathing heavily, and Kim could hear the over-driven heart
bump and check.

'Have they hurt him to the death?'  said the Ao-chung man, while the
others stood mute.

Kim knelt over the body in deadly fear.  'Nay,' he cried passionately,
'this is only a weakness.'  Then he remembered that he was a white man,
with a white man's camp-fittings at his service. 'Open the kiltas!  The
Sahibs may have a medicine.'

'Oho!  Then I know it,' said the Ao-chung man with a laugh.  'Not for
five years was I Yankling Sahib's shikarri without knowing that
medicine.  I too have tasted it.  Behold!'

He drew from his breast a bottle of cheap whisky--such as is sold to
explorers at Leh--and cleverly forced a little between the lama's teeth.

'So I did when Yankling Sahib twisted his foot beyond Astor.  Aha!  I
have already looked into their baskets--but we will make fair division
at Shamlegh.  Give him a little more.  It is good medicine. Feel!  His
heart goes better now.  Lay his head down and rub a little on the
chest.  If he had waited quietly while I accounted for the Sahibs this
would never have come.  But perhaps the Sahibs may chase us here.  Then
it would not be wrong to shoot them with their own guns, heh?'

'One is paid, I think, already,' said Kim between his teeth.  'I kicked
him in the groin as we went downhill.  Would I had killed him!'

'It is well to be brave when one does not live in Rampur,' said one
whose hut lay within a few miles of the Rajah's rickety palace.  'If we
get a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as shikarris any
more.'

'Oh, but these are not Angrezi Sahibs--not merry-minded men like Fostum
Sahib or Yankling Sahib.  They are foreigners--they cannot speak
Angrezi as do Sahibs.'

Here the lama coughed and sat up, groping for the rosary.

'There shall be no killing,' he murmured.  'Just is the Wheel!  Evil on
evil--'

'Nay, Holy One.  We are all here.'  The Ao-chung man timidly patted his
feet.  'Except by thy order, no one shall be slain.  Rest awhile. We
will make a little camp here, and later, as the moon rises, we go to
Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.'

'After a blow,' said a Spiti man sententiously, 'it is best to sleep.'

'There is, as it were, a dizziness at the back of my neck, and a
pinching in it.  Let me lay my head on thy lap, chela.  I am an old
man, but not free from passion ...  We must think of the Cause of
Things.'

'Give him a blanket.  We dare not light a fire lest the Sahibs see.'

'Better get away to Shamlegh.  None will follow us to Shamlegh.'

This was the nervous Rampur man.

'I have been Fostum Sahib's shikarri, and I am Yankling Sahib's
shikarri.  I should have been with Yankling Sahib now but for this
cursed beegar [the corvee].  Let two men watch below with the guns lest
the Sahibs do more foolishness.  I shall not leave this Holy One.'

They sat down a little apart from the lama, and, after listening
awhile, passed round a water-pipe whose receiver was an old Day and
Martin blacking-bottle.  The glow of the red charcoal as it went from
hand to hand lit up the narrow, blinking eyes, the high Chinese
cheek-bones, and the bull-throats that melted away into the dark duffle
folds round the shoulders.  They looked like kobolds from some magic
mine--gnomes of the hills in conclave.  And while they talked, the
voices of the snow-waters round them diminished one by one as the
night-frost choked and clogged the runnels.

'How he stood up against us!'  said a Spiti man admiring.  'I remember
an old ibex, out Ladakh-way, that Dupont Sahib missed on a
shoulder-shot, seven seasons back, standing up just like him.  Dupont
Sahib was a good shikarri.'

'Not as good as Yankling Sahib.'  The Ao-chung man took a pull at the
whisky-bottle and passed it over.  'Now hear me--unless any other man
thinks he knows more.'

The challenge was not taken up.

'We go to Shamlegh when the moon rises.  There we will fairly divide
the baggage between us.  I am content with this new little rifle and
all its cartridges.'

'Are the bears only bad on thy holding?  said a mate, sucking at the
pipe.

'No; but musk-pods are worth six rupees apiece now, and thy women can
have the canvas of the tents and some of the cooking-gear.  We will do
all that at Shamlegh before dawn.  Then we all go our ways, remembering
that we have never seen or taken service with these Sahibs, who may,
indeed, say that we have stolen their baggage.'

'That is well for thee, but what will our Rajah say?'

'Who is to tell him?  Those Sahibs, who cannot speak our talk, or the
Babu, who for his own ends gave us money?  Will he lead an army against
us?  What evidence will remain?  That we do not need we shall throw on
Shamlegh-midden, where no man has yet set foot.'

'Who is at Shamlegh this summer?'  The place was only a grazing centre
of three or four huts.'

'The Woman of Shamlegh.  She has no love for Sahibs, as we know.  The
others can be pleased with little presents; and here is enough for us
all.'  He patted the fat sides of the nearest basket.

'But--but--'

'I have said they are not true Sahibs.  All their skins and heads were
bought in the bazar at Leh.  I know the marks.  I showed them to ye
last march.'

'True.  They were all bought skins and heads.  Some had even the moth
in them.'

That was a shrewd argument, and the Ao-chung man knew his fellows.

'If the worst comes to the worst, I shall tell Yankling Sahib, who is a
man of a merry mind, and he will laugh.  We are not doing any wrong to
any Sahibs whom we know.  They are priest-beaters.  They frightened us.
We fled!  Who knows where we dropped the baggage?  Do ye think Yankling
Sahib will permit down-country police to wander all over the hills,
disturbing his game?  It is a far cry from Simla to Chini, and farther
from Shamlegh to Shamlegh-midden.'

'So be it, but I carry the big kilta.  The basket with the red top that
the Sahibs pack themselves every morning.'

'Thus it is proved,' said the Shamlegh man adroitly, 'that they are
Sahibs of no account.  Who ever heard of Fostum Sahib, or Yankling
Sahib, or even the little Peel Sahib that sits up of nights to shoot
serow--I say, who, ever heard of these Sahibs coming into the hills
without a down-country cook, and a bearer, and--and all manner of
well-paid, high-handed and oppressive folk in their tail?  How can they
make trouble?  What of the kilta?'

'Nothing, but that it is full of the Written Word--books and papers in
which they wrote, and strange instruments, as of worship.'

'Shamlegh-midden will take them all.'

'True!  But how if we insult the Sahibs' Gods thereby!  I do not like
to handle the Written Word in that fashion.  And their brass idols are
beyond my comprehension.  It is no plunder for simple hill-folk.'

'The old man still sleeps.  Hst!  We will ask his chela.'  The Ao-chung
man refreshed himself, and swelled with pride of leadership.

'We have here,' he whispered, 'a kilta whose nature we do not know.'

'But I do,' said Kim cautiously.  The lama drew breath in natural, easy
sleep, and Kim had been thinking of Hurree's last words.  As a player
of the Great Game, he was disposed just then to reverence the Babu.
'It is a kilta with a red top full of very wonderful things, not to be
handled by fools.'

'I said it; I said it,' cried the bearer of that burden.  'Thinkest
thou it will betray us?'

'Not if it be given to me.  I can draw out its magic.  Otherwise it
will do great harm.'

'A priest always takes his share.'  Whisky was demoralizing the
Ao-chung man.

'It is no matter to me.'  Kim answered, with the craft of his
mother-country.  'Share it among you, and see what comes!'

'Not I. I was only jesting.  Give the order.  There is more than enough
for us all.  We go our way from Shamlegh in the dawn.'

They arranged and re-arranged their artless little plans for another
hour, while Kim shivered with cold and pride.  The humour of the
situation tickled the Irish and the Oriental in his soul.  Here were
the emissaries of the dread Power of the North, very possibly as great
in their own land as Mahbub or Colonel Creighton, suddenly smitten
helpless.  One of them, he privately knew, would be lame for a time.
They had made promises to Kings.  Tonight they lay out somewhere below
him, chartless, foodless, tentless, gunless--except for Hurree Babu,
guideless.  And this collapse of their Great Game (Kim wondered to whom
they would report it), this panicky bolt into the night, had come about
through no craft of Hurree's or contrivance of Kim's, but simply,
beautifully, and inevitably as the capture of Mahbub's fakir-friends by
the zealous young policeman at Umballa.

'They are there--with nothing; and, by Jove, it is cold!  I am here
with all their things.  Oh, they will be angry!  I am sorry for Hurree
Babu.'

Kim might have saved his pity, for though at that moment the Bengali
suffered acutely in the flesh, his soul was puffed and lofty.  A mile
down the hill, on the edge of the pine-forest, two half-frozen men--one
powerfully sick at intervals--were varying mutual recriminations with
the most poignant abuse of the Babu, who seemed distraught with terror.
They demanded a plan of action.  He explained that they were very lucky
to be alive; that their coolies, if not then stalking them, had passed
beyond recall; that the Rajah, his master, was ninety miles away, and,
so far from lending them money and a retinue for the Simla journey,
would surely cast them into prison if he heard that they had hit a
priest.  He enlarged on this sin and its consequences till they bade
him change the subject. Their one hope, said he, was unostentatious
flight from village to village till they reached civilization; and, for
the hundredth time dissolved in tears, he demanded of the high stars
why the Sahibs 'had beaten holy man'.

Ten steps would have taken Hurree into the creaking gloom utterly
beyond their reach--to the shelter and food of the nearest village,
where glib-tongued doctors were scarce.  But he preferred to endure
cold, belly-pinch, bad words, and occasional blows in the company of
his honoured employers.  Crouched against a tree-trunk, he sniffed
dolefully.

'And have you thought,' said the uninjured man hotly, 'what sort of
spectacle we shall present wandering through these hills among these
aborigines?'

Hurree Babu had thought of little else for some hours, but the remark
was not to his address.

'We cannot wander!  I can hardly walk,' groaned Kim's victim.

'Perhaps the holy man will be merciful in loving-kindness, sar,
otherwise--'

'I promise myself a peculiar pleasure in emptying my revolver into that
young bonze when next we meet,' was the unchristian answer.

'Revolvers!  Vengeance!  Bonzes!'  Hurree crouched lower.  The war was
breaking out afresh.  'Have you no consideration for our loss?  The
baggage!  The baggage!'  He could hear the speaker literally dancing on
the grass.  'Everything we bore!  Everything we have secured!  Our
gains!  Eight months' work!  Do you know what that means?  "Decidedly
it is we who can deal with Orientals!"  Oh, you have done well.'

They fell to it in several tongues, and Hurree smiled.  Kim was with
the kiltas, and in the kiltas lay eight months of good diplomacy. There
was no means of communicating with the boy, but he could be trusted.
For the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the journey through the
hills that Hilas, Bunar, and four hundred miles of hill-roads should
tell the tale for a generation.  Men who cannot control their own
coolies are little respected in the Hills, and the hillman has a very
keen sense of humour.

'If I had done it myself,' thought Hurree, 'it would not have been
better; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I arranged it
myself.  How quick I have been!  Just when I ran downhill I thought it!
Thee outrage was accidental, but onlee me could have worked it--ah--for
all it was dam'-well worth.  Consider the moral effect upon these
ignorant peoples!  No treaties--no papers--no written documents at
all--and me to interpret for them.  How I shall laugh with the Colonel!
I wish I had their papers also:  but you cannot occupy two places in
space simultaneously.  Thatt is axiomatic.'




Chapter 14


  My brother kneels (so saith Kabir)
  To stone and brass in heathen wise,
  But in my brother's voice I hear
  My own unanswered agonies.
  His God is as his Fates assign--
  His prayer is all the world's--and mine.

  The Prayer.


At moonrise the cautious coolies got under way.  The lama, refreshed by
his sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kim's shoulder to bear
him along--a silent, swift-striding man.  They held the shale-sprinkled
grass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and
climbed into a new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini
valley.  A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow.
At its base was perhaps half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few
soil and timber huts.  Behind them--for, hill-fashion, they were
perched on the edge of all things--the ground fell sheer two thousand
feet to Shamlegh-midden, where never yet man has set foot.

The men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen the
lama bedded down in the best room of the place, with Kim shampooing his
feet, Mohammedan-fashion.

'We will send food,' said the Ao-chung man, 'and the red-topped kilta.
By dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way or the other.  If
anything is not needed in the kilta--see here!'

He pointed through the window--opening into space that was filled with
moonlight reflected from the snow--and threw out an empty whisky-bottle.

'No need to listen for the fall.  This is the world's end,' he said,
and went out.  The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill, with eyes
that shone like yellow opals.  From the enormous pit before him white
peaks lifted themselves yearning to the moonlight.  The rest was as the
darkness of interstellar space.

'These,' he said slowly, 'are indeed my Hills.  Thus should a man
abide, perched above the world, separated from delights, considering
vast matters.'

'Yes; if he has a chela to prepare tea for him, and to fold a blanket
for his head, and to chase out calving cows.'

A smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it down;
and by the mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups, Kim moved
like a tall ghost.

'Ai!  But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats and drums,
and there is a cord round the back of my neck.'

'No wonder.  It was a strong blow.  May he who dealt it--'

'But for my own passions there would have been no evil.'

'What evil?  Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they deserved a
hundred times.'

'The lesson is not well learnt, chela.'  The lama came to rest on a
folded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine.  'The
blow was but a shadow upon a shadow.  Evil in itself--my legs weary
apace these latter days!--it met evil in me:  anger, rage, and a lust
to return evil.  These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my stomach,
and dazzled my ears.'  Here he drank scalding black-tea ceremonially,
taking the hot cup from Kim's hand.  'Had I been passionless, the evil
blow would have done only bodily evil--a scar, or a bruise--which is
illusion.  But my mind was not abstracted, for rushed in straightway a
lust to let the Spiti men kill.  In fighting that lust, my soul was
torn and wrenched beyond a thousand blows.  Not till I had repeated the
Blessings' (he meant the Buddhist Beatitudes) 'did I achieve calm.  But
the evil planted in me by that moment's carelessness works out to its
end.  Just is the Wheel, swerving not a hair!  Learn the lesson, chela.'

'It is too high for me,' Kim muttered.  'I am still all shaken.  I am
glad I hurt the man.'

'I felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below.  It
disquieted me in my dreams--the evil in thy soul working through to
mine.  Yet on the other hand'--he loosed his rosary--'I have acquired
merit by saving two lives--the lives of those that wronged me.  Now I
must see into the Cause of Things.  The boat of my soul staggers.'

'Sleep, and be strong.  That is wisest.'

'I meditate.  There is a need greater than thou knowest.'

Till the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the high
peaks, and that which had been belted blackness on the sides of the far
hills showed as tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly at the
wall.  From time to time he groaned.  Outside the barred door, where
discomfited kine came to ask for their old stable, Shamlegh and the
coolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous living.  The Ao-chung man
was their leader, and once they had opened the Sahibs' tinned foods and
found that they were very good they dared not turn back.  Shamlegh
kitchen-midden took the dunnage.

When Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush his teeth
in the morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with turquoise-studded
headgear drew him aside.

'The others have gone.  They left thee this kilta as the promise was. I
do not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return for it.  We
do not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account of
the--accident.  I am the Woman of Shamlegh.'  She looked him over with
bold, bright eyes, unlike the usual furtive glance of hillwomen.

'Assuredly.  But it must be done in secret.'

She raised the heavy kilta like a toy and slung it into her own hut.

'Out and bar the door!  Let none come near till it is finished,' said
Kim.

'But afterwards--we may talk?'

Kim tilted the kilta on the floor--a cascade of Survey-instruments,
books, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native
correspondence.  At the very bottom was an embroidered bag covering a
sealed, gilded, and illuminated document such as one King sends to
another.  Kim caught his breath with delight, and reviewed the
situation from a Sahib's point of view.

'The books I do not want.  Besides, they are logarithms--Survey, I
suppose.'  He laid them aside.  'The letters I do not understand, but
Colonel Creighton will.  They must all be kept.  The maps--they draw
better maps than me--of course.  All the native letters--oho!--and
particularly the murasla.'  He sniffed the embroidered bag.  'That must
be from Hilas or Bunar, and Hurree Babu spoke truth.  By Jove! It is a
fine haul.  I wish Hurree could know ...  The rest must go out of the
window.'  He fingered a superb prismatic compass and the shiny top of a
theodolite.  But after all, a Sahib cannot very well steal, and the
things might be inconvenient evidence later.  He sorted out every scrap
of manuscript, every map, and the native letters.  They made one
softish slab.  The three locked ferril-backed books, with five worn
pocket-books, he put aside.

'The letters and the murasla I must carry inside my coat and under my
belt, and the hand-written books I must put into the food-bag.  It will
be very heavy.  No.  I do not think there is anything more.  If there
is, the coolies have thrown it down the khud, so thatt is all right.
Now you go too.'  He repacked the kilta with all he meant to lose, and
hove it up on to the windowsill.  A thousand feet below lay a long,
lazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning
sun.  A thousand feet below that was a hundred-year-old pine-forest.
He could see the green tops looking like a bed of moss when a wind-eddy
thinned the cloud.

'No!  I don't think any one will go after you!'

The wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped.  The theodolite
hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books,
inkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds
like a swarm of bees.  Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging
half out of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up
from the gulf.

'Five hundred--a thousand rupees could not buy them,' he thought
sorrowfully.  'It was verree wasteful, but I have all their other
stuff--everything they did--I hope.  Now how the deuce am I to tell
Hurree Babu, and whatt the deuce am I to do?  And my old man is sick. I
must tie up the letters in oilskin.  That is something to do
first--else they will get all sweated ...  And I am all alone!'  He
bound them into a neat packet, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin
at the comers, for his roving life had made him as methodical as an old
hunter in matters of the road.  Then with double care he packed away
the books at the bottom of the food-bag.

The woman rapped at the door.

'But thou hast made no charm,' she said, looking about.

'There is no need.'  Kim had completely overlooked the necessity for a
little patter-talk.  The woman laughed at his confusion irreverently.

'None--for thee.  Thou canst cast a spell by the mere winking of an
eye.  But think of us poor people when thou art gone.  They were all
too drunk last night to hear a woman.  Thou art not drunk?'

'I am a priest.'  Kim had recovered himself, and, the woman being aught
but unlovely, thought best to stand on his office.

'I warned them that the Sahibs will be angry and will make an
inquisition and a report to the Rajah.  There is also the Babu with
them.  Clerks have long tongues.'

'Is that all thy trouble?'  The plan rose fully formed in Kim's mind,
and he smiled ravishingly.

'Not all,' quoth the woman, putting out a hard brown hand all covered
with turquoises set in silver.

'I can finish that in a breath,' he went on quickly.  'The Babu is the
very hakim (thou hast heard of him?) who was wandering among the hills
by Ziglaur.  I know him.'

'He will tell for the sake of a reward.  Sahibs cannot distinguish one
hillman from another, but Babus have eyes for men--and women.'

'Carry a word to him from me.'

'There is nothing I would not do for thee.'

He accepted the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where women
make the love, tore a leaf from a note-book, and with a patent
indelible pencil wrote in gross Shikast--the script that bad little
boys use when they write dirt on walls:  'I have everything that they
have written:  their pictures of the country, and many letters.
Especially the murasla.  Tell me what to do.  I am at
Shamlegh-under-the-Snow.  The old man is sick.'

'Take this to him.  It will altogether shut his mouth.  He cannot have
gone far.'

'Indeed no.  They are still in the forest across the spur.  Our
children went to watch them when the light came, and have cried the
news as they moved.'

Kim looked his astonishment; but from the edge of the sheep-pasture
floated a shrill, kite-like trill.  A child tending cattle had picked
it up from a brother or sister on the far side of the slope that
commanded Chini valley.

'My husbands are also out there gathering wood.'  She drew a handful of
walnuts from her bosom, split one neatly, and began to eat.  Kim
affected blank ignorance.

'Dost thou not know the meaning of the walnut--priest?'  she said
coyly, and handed him the half-shells.

'Well thought of.'  He slipped the piece of paper between them quickly.
'Hast thou a little wax to close them on this letter?'

The woman sighed aloud, and Kim relented.

'There is no payment till service has been rendered.  Carry this to the
Babu, and say it was sent by the Son of the Charm.'

'Ai!  Truly!  Truly!  By a magician--who is like a Sahib.'

'Nay, a Son of the Charm:  and ask if there be any answer.'

'But if he offer a rudeness?  I--I am afraid.'

Kim laughed.  'He is, I have no doubt, very tired and very hungry. The
Hills make cold bedfellows.  Hai, my'--it was on the tip of his tongue
to say Mother, but he turned it to Sister--'thou art a wise and witty
woman.  By this time all the villages know what has befallen the
Sahibs--eh?'

'True.  News was at Ziglaur by midnight, and by tomorrow should be at
Kotgarh.  The villages are both afraid and angry.'

'No need.  Tell the villages to feed the Sahibs and pass them on, in
peace.  We must get them quietly away from our valleys.  To steal is
one thing--to kill another.  The Babu will understand, and there will
be no after-complaints.  Be swift.  I must tend my master when he
wakes.'

'So be it.  After service--thou hast said?--comes the reward.  I am the
Woman of Shamlegh, and I hold from the Rajah.  I am no common bearer of
babes.  Shamlegh is thine:  hoof and horn and hide, milk and butter.
Take or leave.'

She turned resolutely uphill, her silver necklaces clicking on her
broad breast, to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet above them.
This time Kim thought in the vernacular as he waxed down the oilskin
edges of the packets.

'How can a man follow the Way or the Great Game when he is so--always
pestered by women?  There was that girl at Akrola of the Ford; and
there was the scullion's wife behind the dovecot--not counting the
others--and now comes this one!  When I was a child it was well enough,
but now I am a man and they will not regard me as a man. Walnuts,
indeed!  Ho!  ho!  It is almonds in the Plains!'

He went out to levy on the village--not with a begging-bowl, which
might do for down-country, but in the manner of a prince.  Shamlegh's
summer population is only three families--four women and eight or nine
men.  They were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks, from
ammoniated quinine to white vodka, for they had taken their full share
in the overnight loot.  The neat Continental tents had been cut up and
shared long ago, and there were patent aluminium saucepans abroad.

But they considered the lama's presence a perfect safeguard against all
consequences, and impenitently brought Kim of their best--even to a
drink of chang--the barley-beer that comes from Ladakh-way. Then they
thawed out in the sun, and sat with their legs hanging over infinite
abysses, chattering, laughing, and smoking.  They judged India and its
Government solely from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had
employed them or their friends as shikarris.  Kim heard tales of shots
missed upon ibex, serow, or markhor, by Sahibs twenty years in their
graves--every detail lighted from behind like twigs on tree-tops seen
against lightning. They told him of their little diseases, and, more
important, the diseases of their tiny, sure-footed cattle; of trips as
far as Kotgarh, where the strange missionaries live, and beyond even to
marvellous Simla, where the streets are paved with silver, and anyone,
look you, can get service with the Sahibs, who ride about in
two-wheeled carts and spend money with a spade.  Presently, grave and
aloof, walking very heavily, the lama joined himself to the chatter
under the eaves, and they gave him great room.  The thin air refreshed
him, and he sat on the edge of precipices with the best of them, and,
when talk languished, flung pebbles into the void.  Thirty miles away,
as the eagle flies, lay the next range, seamed and channelled and
pitted with little patches of brush--forests, each a day's dark march.
Behind the village, Shamlegh hill itself cut off all view to southward.
It was like sitting in a swallow's nest under the eaves of the roof of
the world.

From time to time the lama stretched out his hand, and with a little
low-voiced prompting would point out the road to Spiti and north across
the Parungla.

'Beyond, where the hills lie thickest, lies De-ch'en' (he meant
Han-le'), 'the great Monastery.  s'Tag-stan-ras-ch'en built it, and of
him there runs this tale.'  Whereupon he told it:  a fantastic piled
narrative of bewitchment and miracles that set Shamlegh a-gasping.
Turning west a little, he steered for the green hills of Kulu, and
sought Kailung under the glaciers.  'For thither came I in the old, old
days.  From Leh I came, over the Baralachi.'

'Yes, yes; we know it,' said the far-faring people of Shamlegh.

'And I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung.  These are the
Hills of my delight!  Shadows blessed above all other shadows!  There
my eyes opened on this world; there my eyes were opened to this world;
there I found Enlightenment; and there I girt my loins for my Search.
Out of the Hills I came--the high Hills and the strong winds.  Oh, just
is the Wheel!'  He blessed them in detail--the great glaciers, the
naked rocks, the piled moraines and tumbled shale; dry upland, hidden
salt-lake, age-old timber and fruitful water-shot valley one after the
other, as a dying man blesses his folk; and Kim marvelled at his
passion.

'Yes--yes.  There is no place like our Hills,' said the people of
Shamlegh.  And they fell to wondering how a man could live in the hot
terrible Plains where the cattle run as big as elephants, unfit to
plough on a hillside; where village touches village, they had heard,
for a hundred miles; where folk went about stealing in gangs, and what
the robbers spared the Police carried utterly away.

So the still forenoon wore through, and at the end of it Kim's
messenger dropped from the steep pasture as unbreathed as when she had
set out.

'I sent a word to the hakim,' Kim explained, while she made reverence.

'He joined himself to the idolaters?  Nay, I remember he did a healing
upon one of them.  He has acquired merit, though the healed employed
his strength for evil.  Just is the Wheel!  What of the hakim?'

'I feared that thou hadst been bruised and--and I knew he was wise.'
Kim took the waxed walnut-shell and read in English on the back of his
note:  Your favour received.  Cannot get away from present company at
present, but shall take them into Simla.  After which, hope to rejoin
you.  Inexpedient to follow angry gentlemen.  Return by same road you
came, and will overtake.  Highly gratified about correspondence due to
my forethought.  'He says, Holy One, that he will escape from the
idolaters, and will return to us.  Shall we wait awhile at Shamlegh,
then?'

The lama looked long and lovingly upon the hills and shook his head.

'That may not be, chela.  From my bones outward I do desire it, but it
is forbidden.  I have seen the Cause of Things.'

'Why?  When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by day? Remember
we were weak and fainting down below there in the Doon.'

'I became strong to do evil and to forget.  A brawler and a
swashbuckler upon the hillsides was I.' Kim bit back a smile.  'Just
and perfect is the Wheel, swerving not a hair.  When I was a man--a
long time ago--I did pilgrimage to Guru Ch'wan among the poplars' (he
pointed Bhotanwards), 'where they keep the Sacred Horse.'

'Quiet, be quiet!'  said Shamlegh, all arow.  'He speaks of
Jam-lin-nin-k'or, the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day.'

'I speak to my chela only,' said the lama, in gentle reproof, and they
scattered like frost on south eaves of a morning.  'I did not seek
truth in those days, but the talk of doctrine.  All illusion!  I drank
the beer and ate the bread of Guru Ch'wan.  Next day one said: "We go
out to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discover" (mark again how
Lust is tied to Anger!) "which Abbot shall bear rule in the valley and
take the profit of the prayers they print at Sangor Gutok."  I went,
and we fought a day.'

'But how, Holy One?'

'With our long pencases as I could have shown ...  I say, we fought
under the poplars, both Abbots and all the monks, and one laid open my
forehead to the bone.  See!'  He tilted back his cap and showed a
puckered silvery scar.  'Just and perfect is the Wheel! Yesterday the
scar itched, and after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the
face of him who dealt it; dwelling a little in illusion.  Followed that
which thou didst see--strife and stupidity. Just is the Wheel!  The
idolater's blow fell upon the scar.  Then I was shaken in my soul:  my
soul was darkened, and the boat of my soul rocked upon the waters of
illusion.  Not till I came to Shamlegh could I meditate upon the Cause
of Things, or trace the running grass-roots of Evil.  I strove all the
long night.'

'But, Holy One, thou art innocent of all evil.  May I be thy sacrifice!'

Kim was genuinely distressed at the old man's sorrow, and Mahbub Ali's
phrase slipped out unawares.

'In the dawn,' the lama went on more gravely, ready rosary clicking
between the slow sentences, 'came enlightenment.  It is here ...  I am
an old man ...  hill-bred, hill-fed, never to sit down among my Hills.
Three years I travelled through Hind, but--can earth be stronger than
Mother Earth?  My stupid body yearned to the Hills and the snows of the
Hills, from below there.  I said, and it is true, my Search is sure.
So, at the Kulu woman's house I turned hillward, over-persuaded by
myself.  There is no blame to the hakim.  He--following
Desire--foretold that the Hills would make me strong. They strengthened
me to do evil, to forget my Search.  I delighted in life and the lust
of life.  I desired strong slopes to climb.  I cast about to find them.
I measured the strength of my body, which is evil, against the high
Hills, I made a mock of thee when thy breath came short under Jamnotri.
I jested when thou wouldst not face the snow of the pass.'

'But what harm?  I was afraid.  It was just.  I am not a hillman; and I
loved thee for thy new strength.'

'More than once I remember'--he rested his cheek dolefully on his
hand--'I sought thy praise and the hakim's for the mere strength of my
legs.  Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full.  Just is the
Wheel!  All Hind for three years did me all honour.  From the Fountain
of Wisdom in the Wonder House to'--he smiled--'a little child playing
by a big gun--the world prepared my road.  And why?'

'Because we loved thee.  It is only the fever of the blow.  I myself am
still sick and shaken.'

'No!  It was because I was upon the Way--tuned as are si-nen [cymbals]
to the purpose of the Law.  I departed from that ordinance. The tune
was broken:  followed the punishment.  In my own Hills, on the edge of
my own country, in the very place of my evil desire, comes the
buffet--here!'  (He touched his brow.) 'As a novice is beaten when he
misplaces the cups, so am I beaten, who was Abbot of Such-zen.  No
word, look you, but a blow, chela.'

'But the Sahibs did not know thee, Holy One?'

'We were well matched.  Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and Lust upon
the road, and they begat Anger.  The blow was a sign to me, who am no
better than a strayed yak, that my place is not here.  Who can read the
Cause of an act is halfway to Freedom!  "Back to the path," says the
Blow.  "The Hills are not for thee.  Thou canst not choose Freedom and
go in bondage to the delight of life."'

'Would we had never met that cursed Russian!'

'Our Lord Himself cannot make the Wheel swing backward.  And for my
merit that I had acquired I gain yet another sign.'  He put his hand in
his bosom, and drew forth the Wheel of Life.  'Look!  I considered this
after I had meditated.  There remains untorn by the idolater no more
than the breadth of my fingernail.'

'I see.'

'So much, then, is the span of my life in this body.  I have served the
Wheel all my days.  Now the Wheel serves me.  But for the merit I have
acquired in guiding thee upon the Way, there would have been added to
me yet another life ere I had found my River.  Is it plain, chela?'

Kim stared at the brutally disfigured chart.  From left to right
diagonally the rent ran--from the Eleventh House where Desire gives
birth to the Child (as it is drawn by Tibetans)--across the human and
animal worlds, to the Fifth House--the empty House of the Senses.  The
logic was unanswerable.

'Before our Lord won Enlightenment'--the lama folded all away with
reverence--'He was tempted.  I too have been tempted, but it is
finished.  The Arrow fell in the Plains--not in the Hills. Therefore,
what make we here?'

'Shall we at least wait for the hakim?'

'I know how long I shall live in this body.  What can a hakim do?'

'But thou art all sick and shaken.  Thou canst not walk.'

'How can I be sick if I see Freedom?'  He rose unsteadily to his feet.

'Then I must get food from the village.  Oh, the weary Road!'  Kim felt
that he too needed rest.

'That is lawful.  Let us eat and go.  The Arrow fell in the Plains ...
but I yielded to Desire.  Make ready, chela.'

Kim turned to the woman with the turquoise headgear who had been idly
pitching pebbles over the cliff.  She smiled very kindly.

'I found him like a strayed buffalo in a cornfield--the Babu; snorting
and sneezing with cold.  He was so hungry that he forgot his dignity
and gave me sweet words.  The Sahibs have nothing.'  She flung out an
empty palm.  'One is very sick about the stomach.  Thy work?'

Kim nodded, with a bright eye.

'I spoke to the Bengali first--and to the people of a near-by village
after.  The Sahibs will be given food as they need it--nor will the
people ask money.  The plunder is already distributed.  The Babu makes
lying speeches to the Sahibs.  Why does he not leave them?'

'Out of the greatness of his heart.'

'Was never a Bengali yet had one bigger than a dried walnut.  But it is
no matter ...  Now as to walnuts.  After service comes reward.  I have
said the village is thine.'

'It is my loss,' Kim began.  'Even now I had planned desirable things
in my heart which'--there is no need to go through the compliments
proper to these occasions.  He sighed deeply ...  'But my master, led
by a vision--'

'Huh!  What can old eyes see except a full begging-bowl?'

'--turns from this village to the Plains again.'

'Bid him stay.'

Kim shook his head.  'I know my Holy One, and his rage if he be
crossed,' he replied impressively.  'His curses shake the Hills.'

'Pity they did not save him from a broken head!  I heard that thou wast
the tiger-hearted one who smote the Sahib.  Let him dream a little
longer.  Stay!'

'Hillwoman,' said Kim, with austerity that could not harden the
outlines of his young oval face, 'these matters are too high for thee.'

'The Gods be good to us!  Since when have men and women been other than
men and women?'

'A priest is a priest.  He says he will go upon this hour.  I am his
chela, and I go with him.  We need food for the Road.  He is an
honoured guest in all the villages, but'--he broke into a pure boy's
grin--'the food here is good.  Give me some.'

'What if I do not give it thee?  I am the woman of this village.'

'Then I curse thee--a little--not greatly, but enough to remember.'  He
could not help smiling.

'Thou hast cursed me already by the down-dropped eyelash and the
uplifted chin.  Curses?  What should I care for mere words?'  She
clenched her hands upon her bosom ...  'But I would not have thee to go
in anger, thinking hardly of me--a gatherer of cow-dung and grass at
Shamlegh, but still a woman of substance.'

'I think nothing,' said Kim, 'but that I am grieved to go, for I am
very weary; and that we need food.  Here is the bag.'

The woman snatched it angrily.  'I was foolish,' said she.  'Who is thy
woman in the Plains?  Fair or black?  I was fair once.  Laughest thou?
Once, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with
favour.  Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house
yonder.'  She pointed towards Kotgarh.  'Once, long ago.  I was
Ker-lis-ti-an and spoke English--as the Sahibs speak it.  Yes.  My
Sahib said he would return and wed me--yes, wed me.  He went away--I
had nursed him when he was sick--but he never returned.  Then I saw
that the Gods of the Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my own people
...  I have never set eyes on a Sahib since.  (Do not laugh at me.  The
fit is past, little priestling.) Thy face and thy walk and thy fashion
of speech put me in mind of my Sahib, though thou art only a wandering
mendicant to whom I give a dole.  Curse me?  Thou canst neither curse
nor bless!'  She set her hands on her hips and laughed bitterly.  'Thy
Gods are lies; thy works are lies; thy words are lies.  There are no
Gods under all the Heavens.  I know it ...  But for awhile I thought it
was my Sahib come back, and he was my God. Yes, once I made music on a
pianno in the Mission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who
are heatthen.'  She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth
of the brimming bag.

'I wait for thee, chela,' said the lama, leaning against the door-post.

The woman swept the tall figure with her eyes.  'He walk!  He cannot
cover half a mile.  Whither would old bones go?'

At this Kim, already perplexed by the lama's collapse and foreseeing
the weight of the bag, fairly lost his temper.

'What is it to thee, woman of ill-omen, where he goes?'

'Nothing--but something to thee, priest with a Sahib's face.  Wilt thou
carry him on thy shoulders?'

'I go to the Plains.  None must hinder my return.  I have wrestled with
my soul till I am strengthless.  The stupid body is spent, and we are
far from the Plains.'

'Behold!'  she said simply, and drew aside to let Kim see his own utter
helplessness.  'Curse me.  Maybe it will give him strength.  Make a
charm!  Call on thy great God.  Thou art a priest.'  She turned away.

The lama had squatted limply, still holding by the door-post.  One
cannot strike down an old man that he recovers again like a boy in the
night.  Weakness bowed him to the earth, but his eyes that hung on Kim
were alive and imploring.

'It is all well,' said Kim.  'It is the thin air that weakens thee. In
a little while we go!  It is the mountain-sickness.  I too am a little
sick at stomach,'--and he knelt and comforted with such poor words as
came first to his lips.  Then the woman returned, more erect than ever.

'Thy Gods useless, heh?  Try mine.  I am the Woman of Shamlegh.'  She
hailed hoarsely, and there came out of a cow-pen her two husbands and
three others with a dooli, the rude native litter of the Hills, that
they use for carrying the sick and for visits of state.  'These
cattle'--she did not condescend to look at them--'are thine for so long
as thou shalt need.'

'But we will not go Simla-way.  We will not go near the Sahibs,' cried
the first husband.

'They will not run away as the others did, nor will they steal baggage.
Two I know for weaklings.  Stand to the rear-pole, Sonoo and Taree.'
They obeyed swiftly.  'Lower now, and lift in that holy man. I will see
to the village and your virtuous wives till ye return.'

'When will that be?'

'Ask the priests.  Do not pester me.  Lay the food-bag at the foot, it
balances better so.'

'Oh, Holy One, thy Hills are kinder than our Plains!'  cried Kim,
relieved, as the lama tottered to the litter.  'It is a very king's
bed--a place of honour and ease.  And we owe it to--'

'A woman of ill-omen.  I need thy blessings as much as I do thy curses.
It is my order and none of thine.  Lift and away!  Here!  Hast thou
money for the road?'

She beckoned Kim to her hut, and stooped above a battered English
cash-box under her cot.

'I do not need anything,' said Kim, angered where he should have been
grateful.  'I am already rudely loaded with favours.'

She looked up with a curious smile and laid a hand on his shoulder. 'At
least, thank me.  I am foul-faced and a hillwoman, but, as thy talk
goes, I have acquired merit.  Shall I show thee how the Sahibs render
thanks?'  and her hard eyes softened.

'I am but a wandering priest,' said Kim, his eyes lighting in answer.
'Thou needest neither my blessings nor my curses.'

'Nay.  But for one little moment--thou canst overtake the dooli in ten
strides--if thou wast a Sahib, shall I show thee what thou wouldst do?'

'How if I guess, though?'  said Kim, and putting his arm round her
waist, he kissed her on the cheek, adding in English:  'Thank you
verree much, my dear.'

Kissing is practically unknown among Asiatics, which may have been the
reason that she leaned back with wide-open eyes and a face of panic.

'Next time,' Kim went on, 'you must not be so sure of your heatthen
priests.  Now I say good-bye.'  He held out his hand English-fashion.
She took it mechanically.  'Good-bye, my dear.'

'Good-bye, and--and'--she was remembering her English words one by
one--'you will come back again?  Good-bye, and--thee God bless you.'

Half an hour later, as the creaking litter jolted up the hill path that
leads south-easterly from Shamlegh, Kim saw a tiny figure at the hut
door waving a white rag.

'She has acquired merit beyond all others,' said the lama.  'For to set
a man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she had
herself found it.'

'Umm,' said Kim thoughtfully, considering the past.  'It may be that I
have acquired merit also ...  At least she did not treat me like a
child.'  He hitched the front of his robe, where lay the slab of
documents and maps, re-stowed the precious food-bag at the lama's feet,
laid his hand on the litter's edge, and buckled down to the slow pace
of the grunting husbands.

'These also acquire merit,' said the lama after three miles.

'More than that, they shall be paid in silver,' quoth Kim.  The Woman
of Shamlegh had given it to him; and it was only fair, he argued, that
her men should earn it back again.




Chapter 15


  I'd not give room for an Emperor--
  I'd hold my road for a King.
  To the Triple Crown I'd not bow down--
  But this is a different thing!
  I'll not fight with the Powers of Air--
  Sentry, pass him through!
  Drawbridge let fall--He's the Lord of us all--
  The Dreamer whose dream came true!

  The Siege of the Fairies.


Two hundred miles north of Chini, on the blue shale of Ladakh, lies
Yankling Sahib, the merry-minded man, spy-glassing wrathfully across
the ridges for some sign of his pet tracker--a man from Ao-chung. But
that renegade, with a new Mannlicher rifle and two hundred cartridges,
is elsewhere, shooting musk-deer for the market, and Yankling Sahib
will learn next season how very ill he has been.

Up the valleys of Bushahr--the far-beholding eagles of the Himalayas
swerve at his new blue-and-white gored umbrella--hurries a Bengali,
once fat and well-looking, now lean and weather-worn.  He has received
the thanks of two foreigners of distinction, piloted not unskilfully to
Mashobra tunnel, which leads to the great and gay capital of India.  It
was not his fault that, blanketed by wet mists, he conveyed them past
the telegraph-station and European colony of Kotgarh.  It was not his
fault, but that of the Gods, of whom he discoursed so engagingly, that
he led them into the borders of Nahan, where the Rahah of that State
mistook them for deserting British soldiery.  Hurree Babu explained the
greatness and glory, in their own country, of his companions, till the
drowsy kinglet smiled.  He explained it to everyone who asked--many
times--aloud--variously.  He begged food, arranged accommodation,
proved a skilful leech for an injury of the groin--such a blow as one
may receive rolling down a rock-covered hillside in the dark--and in
all things indispensable.  The reason of his friendliness did him
credit.  With millions of fellow-serfs, he had learned to look upon
Russia as the great deliverer from the North.  He was a fearful man.
He had been afraid that he could not save his illustrious employers
from the anger of an excited peasantry.  He himself would just as lief
hit a holy man as not, but ...  He was deeply grateful and sincerely
rejoiced that he had done his 'little possible' towards bringing their
venture to--barring the lost baggage--a successful issue, he had
forgotten the blows; denied that any blows had been dealt that unseemly
first night under the pines.  He asked neither pension nor retaining
fee, but, if they deemed him worthy, would they write him a
testimonial?  It might be useful to him later, if others, their
friends, came over the Passes.  He begged them to remember him in their
future greatnesses, for he 'opined subtly' that he, even he, Mohendro
Lal Dutt, MA of Calcutta, had 'done the State some service'.

They gave him a certificate praising his courtesy, helpfulness, and
unerring skill as a guide.  He put it in his waist-belt and sobbed with
emotion; they had endured so many dangers together.  He led them at
high noon along crowded Simla Mall to the Alliance Bank of Simla, where
they wished to establish their identity.  Thence he vanished like a
dawn-cloud on Jakko.

Behold him, too fine-drawn to sweat, too pressed to vaunt the drugs in
his little brass-bound box, ascending Shamlegh slope, a just man made
perfect.  Watch him, all Babudom laid aside, smoking at noon on a cot,
while a woman with turquoise-studded headgear points south-easterly
across the bare grass.  Litters, she says, do not travel as fast as
single men, but his birds should now be in the Plains.  The holy man
would not stay though Lispeth pressed him.  The Babu groans heavily,
girds up his huge loins, and is off again.  He does not care to travel
after dusk; but his days' marches--there is none to enter them in a
book--would astonish folk who mock at his race.  Kindly villagers,
remembering the Dacca drug-vendor of two months ago, give him shelter
against evil spirits of the wood.  He dreams of Bengali Gods,
University text-books of education, and the Royal Society, London,
England.  Next dawn the bobbing blue-and-white umbrella goes forward.

On the edge of the Doon, Mussoorie well behind them and the Plains
spread out in golden dust before, rests a worn litter in which--all the
Hills know it--lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing.
Villages have almost come to blows over the honour of bearing it, for
not only has the lama given them blessings, but his disciple good
money--full one-third Sahibs' prices.  Twelve miles a day has the dooli
travelled, as the greasy, rubbed pole-ends show, and by roads that few
Sahibs use.  Over the Nilang Pass in storm when the driven snow-dust
filled every fold of the impassive lama's drapery; between the black
horns of Raieng where they heard the whistle of the wild goats through
the clouds; pitching and strained on the shale below; hard-held between
shoulder and clenched jaw when they rounded the hideous curves of the
Cut Road under Bhagirati; swinging and creaking to the steady jog-trot
of the descent into the Valley of the Waters; pressed along the steamy
levels of that locked valley; up, up and out again, to meet the roaring
gusts off Kedarnath; set down of mid-days in the dun gloom of kindly
oak-forests; passed from village to village in dawn-chill, when even
devotees may be forgiven for swearing at impatient holy men; or by
torchlight, when the least fearful think of ghosts--the dooli has
reached her last stage.  The little hill-folk sweat in the modified
heat of the lower Siwaliks, and gather round the priests for their
blessing and their wage.

'Ye have acquired merit,' says the lama.  'Merit greater than your
knowing.  And ye will return to the Hills,' he sighs.

'Surely.  The high Hills as soon as may be.'  The bearer rubs his
shoulder, drinks water, spits it out again, and readjusts his grass
sandal.  Kim--his face is drawn and tired--pays very small silver from
his belt, heaves out the food-bag, crams an oilskin packet--they are
holy writings--into his bosom, and helps the lama to his feet.  The
peace has come again into the old man's eyes, and he does not look for
the hills to fall down and crush him as he did that terrible night when
they were delayed by the flooded river.

The men pick up the dooli and swing out of sight between the scrub
clumps.

The lama raises a hand toward the rampart of the Himalayas.  'Not with
you, O blessed among all hills, fell the Arrow of Our Lord!  And never
shall I breathe your airs again!'

'But thou art ten times the stronger man in this good air,' says Kim,
for to his wearied soul appeal the well-cropped, kindly Plains. 'Here,
or hereabouts, fell the Arrow, yes.  We will go very softly, perhaps, a
koss a day, for the Search is sure.  But the bag weighs heavy.'

'Ay, our Search is sure.  I have come out of great temptation.'

It was never more than a couple of miles a day now, and Kim's shoulders
bore all the weight of it--the burden of an old man, the burden of the
heavy food-bag with the locked books, the load of the writings on his
heart, and the details of the daily routine.  He begged in the dawn,
set blankets for the lama's meditation, held the weary head on his lap
through the noonday heats, fanning away the flies till his wrists
ached, begged again in the evenings, and rubbed the lama's feet, who
rewarded him with promise of Freedom--today, tomorrow, or, at furthest,
the next day.

'Never was such a chela.  I doubt at times whether Ananda more
faithfully nursed Our Lord.  And thou art a Sahib?  When I was a man--a
long time ago--I forgot that.  Now I look upon thee often, and every
time I remember that thou art a Sahib.  It is strange.'

'Thou hast said there is neither black nor white.  Why plague me with
this talk, Holy One?  Let me rub the other foot.  It vexes me.  I am
not a Sahib.  I am thy chela, and my head is heavy on my shoulders.'

'Patience a little!  We reach Freedom together.  Then thou and I, upon
the far bank of the River, will look back upon our lives as in the
Hills we saw our days' marches laid out behind us.  Perhaps I was once
a Sahib.'

'Was never a Sahib like thee, I swear it.'

'I am certain the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House was in past
life a very wise Abbot.  But even his spectacles do not make my eyes
see.  There fall shadows when I would look steadily.  No matter--we
know the tricks of the poor stupid carcass--shadow changing to another
shadow.  I am bound by the illusion of Time and Space.  How far came we
today in the flesh?'

'Perhaps half a koss.'  (Three quarters of a mile, and it was a weary
march.)

'Half a koss.  Ha!  I went ten thousand thousand in the spirit.  How,
we are all lapped and swathed and swaddled in these senseless things.'
He looked at his thin blue-veined hand that found the beads so heavy.
'Chela, hast thou never a wish to leave me?'

Kim thought of the oilskin packet and the books in the food-bag.  If
someone duly authorized would only take delivery of them the Great Game
might play itself for aught he then cared.  He was tired and hot in his
head, and a cough that came from the stomach worried him.

'No.'  he said almost sternly.  'I am not a dog or a snake to bite when
I have learned to love.'

'Thou art too tender towards me.'

'Not that either.  I have moved in one matter without consulting thee.
I have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the
goat's milk this morn, saying that thou wast a little feeble and
wouldst need a litter.  I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it
when we entered the Doon.  We stay in this place till the litter
returns.'

'I am content.  She is a woman with a heart of gold, as thou sayest,
but a talker--something of a talker.'

'She will not weary thee.  I have looked to that also.  Holy One, my
heart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee.'  An
hysterical catch rose in his throat.  'I have walked thee too far:  I
have not picked good food always for thee; I have not considered the
heat; I have talked to people on the road and left thee alone ...  I
have--I have ...  Hai mai!  But I love thee ...  and it is all too late
...  I was a child ...  Oh, why was I not a man?  ...' Overborne by
strain, fatigue, and the weight beyond his years, Kim broke down and
sobbed at the lama's feet.

'What a to-do is here!'  said the old man gently.  'Thou hast never
stepped a hair's breadth from the Way of Obedience.  Neglect me? Child,
I have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the lime of a new
wall.  Day by day, since Shamlegh down, I have stolen strength from
thee.  Therefore, not through any sin of thine, art thou weakened.  It
is the Body--the silly, stupid Body--that speaks now.  Not the assured
Soul.  Be comforted!  Know at least the devils that thou fightest.
They are earth-born--children of illusion.  We will go to the woman
from Kulu.  She shall acquire merit in housing us, and specially in
tending me.  Thou shalt run free till strength returns.  I had
forgotten the stupid Body.  If there be any blame, I bear it.  But we
are too close to the Gates of Deliverance to weigh blame.  I could
praise thee, but what need?  In a little--in a very little--we shall
sit beyond all needs.'

And so he petted and comforted Kim with wise saws and grave texts on
that little-understood beast, our Body, who, being but a delusion,
insists on posing as the Soul, to the darkening of the Way, and the
immense multiplication of unnecessary devils.

'Hai!  hai!  Let us talk of the woman from Kulu.  Think you she will
ask another charm for her grandsons?  When I was a young man, a very
long time ago, I was plagued with these vapours--and some others--and I
went to an Abbot--a very holy man and a seeker after truth, though then
I knew it not.  Sit up and listen, child of my soul!  My tale was told.
Said he to me, "Chela, know this.  There are many lies in the world,
and not a few liars, but there are no liars like our bodies, except it
be the sensations of our bodies."  Considering this I was comforted,
and of his great favour he suffered me to drink tea In his presence.
Suffer me now to drink tea, for I am thirsty.'

With a laugh across his tears, Kim kissed the lama's feet, and set
about the tea-making.

'Thou leanest on me in the body, Holy One, but I lean on thee for some
other things.  Dost know it?'

'I have guessed maybe,' and the lama's eyes twinkled.  'We must change
that.'

So, when with scufflings and scrapings and a hot air of importance,
paddled up nothing less than the Sahiba's pet palanquin sent twenty
miles, with that same grizzled old Oorya servant in charge, and when
they reached the disorderly order of the long white rambling house
behind Saharunpore, the lama took his own measures.

Said the Sahiba cheerily from an upper window, after compliments: 'What
is the good of an old woman's advice to an old man?  I told thee--I
told thee, Holy One, to keep an eye upon the chela.  How didst thou do
it?  Never answer me!  I know.  He has been running among the women.
Look at his eyes--hollow and sunk--and the Betraying Line from the nose
down!  He has been sifted out!  Fie!  Fie!  And a priest, too!'

Kim looked up, over-weary to smile, shaking his head in denial.

'Do not jest,' said the lama.  'That time is done.  We are here upon
great matters.  A sickness of soul took me in the Hills, and him a
sickness of the body.  Since then I have lived upon his
strength--eating him.'

'Children together--young and old,' she sniffed, but forbore to make
any new jokes.  'May this present hospitality restore ye!  Hold awhile
and I will come to gossip of the high good Hills.'

At evening time--her son-in-law was returned, so she did not need to go
on inspection round the farm--she won to the meat of the matter,
explained low-voicedly by the lama.  The two old heads nodded wisely
together.  Kim had reeled to a room with a cot in it, and was dozing
soddenly.  The lama had forbidden him to set blankets or get food.

'I know--I know.  Who but I?' she cackled.  'We who go down to the
burning-ghats clutch at the hands of those coming up from the River of
Life with full water-jars--yes, brimming water-jars.  I did the boy
wrong.  He lent thee his strength?  It is true that the old eat the
young daily.  Stands now we must restore him.'

'Thou hast many times acquired merit--'

'My merit.  What is it?  Old bag of bones making curries for men who do
not ask "Who cooked this?"  Now if it were stored up for my grandson--'

'He that had the belly-pain?'

'To think the Holy One remembers that!  I must tell his mother.  It is
most singular honour!  "He that had the belly-pain"--straightway the
Holy One remembered.  She will be proud.'

'My chela is to me as is a son to the unenlightened.'

'Say grandson, rather.  Mothers have not the wisdom of our years.  If a
child cries they say the heavens are falling.  Now a grandmother is far
enough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving
the breast to consider whether a cry is wickedness pure or the wind.
And since thou speakest once again of wind, when last the Holy One was
here, maybe I offended in pressing for charms.'

'Sister,' said the lama, using that form of address a Buddhist monk may
sometimes employ towards a nun, 'if charms comfort thee--'

'They are better than ten thousand doctors.'

'I say, if they comfort thee, I who was Abbot of Such-zen, will make as
many as thou mayest desire.  I have never seen thy face--'

'That even the monkeys who steal our loquats count for again.  Hee!
hee!'

'But as he who sleeps there said,'--he nodded at the shut door of the
guest-chamber across the forecourt--'thou hast a heart of gold... And
he is in the spirit my very "grandson" to me.'

'Good!  I am the Holy One's cow.'  This was pure Hinduism, but the lama
never heeded.  'I am old.  I have borne sons in the body.  Oh, once I
could please men!  Now I can cure them.'  He heard her armlets tinkle
as though she bared arms for action.  'I will take over the boy and
dose him, and stuff him, and make him all whole.  Hai!  hai! We old
people know something yet.'

Wherefore when Kim, aching in every bone, opened his eyes, and would go
to the cook-house to get his master's food, he found strong coercion
about him, and a veiled old figure at the door, flanked by the grizzled
manservant, who told him very precisely the things that he was on no
account to do.

'Thou must have?  Thou shalt have nothing.  What?  A locked box in
which to keep holy books?  Oh, that is another matter.  Heavens forbid
I should come between a priest and his prayers!  It shall be brought,
and thou shalt keep the key.'

They pushed the coffer under his cot, and Kim shut away Mahbub's
pistol, the oilskin packet of letters, and the locked books and
diaries, with a groan of relief.  For some absurd reason their weight
on his shoulders was nothing to their weight on his poor mind.  His
neck ached under it of nights.

'Thine is a sickness uncommon in youth these days:  since young folk
have given up tending their betters.  The remedy is sleep, and certain
drugs,' said the Sahiba; and he was glad to give himself up to the
blankness that half menaced and half soothed him.

She brewed drinks, in some mysterious Asiatic equivalent to the
still-room--drenches that smelt pestilently and tasted worse.  She
stood over Kim till they went down, and inquired exhaustively after
they had come up.  She laid a taboo upon the forecourt, and enforced it
by means of an armed man.  It is true he was seventy odd, that his
scabbarded sword ceased at the hilt; but he represented the authority
of the Sahiba, and loaded wains, chattering servants, calves, dogs,
hens, and the like, fetched a wide compass by those parts.  Best of
all, when the body was cleared, she cut out from the mass of poor
relations that crowded the back of the buildings--house-hold dogs, we
name them--a cousin's widow, skilled in what Europeans, who know
nothing about it, call massage.  And the two of them, laying him east
and west, that the mysterious earth-currents which thrill the clay of
our bodies might help and not hinder, took him to pieces all one long
afternoon--bone by bone, muscle by muscle, ligament by ligament, and
lastly, nerve by nerve.  Kneaded to irresponsible pulp, half hypnotized
by the perpetual flick and readjustment of the uneasy chudders that
veiled their eyes, Kim slid ten thousand miles into slumber--thirty-six
hours of it--sleep that soaked like rain after drought.

Then she fed him, and the house spun to her clamour.  She caused fowls
to be slain; she sent for vegetables, and the sober, slow-thinking
gardener, nigh as old as she, sweated for it; she took spices, and
milk, and onion, with little fish from the brooks--anon limes for
sherbets, fat quails from the pits, then chicken-livers upon a skewer,
with sliced ginger between.

'I have seen something of this world,' she said over the crowded trays,
'and there are but two sorts of women in it--those who take the
strength out of a man and those who put it back.  Once I was that one,
and now I am this.  Nay--do not play the priestling with me. Mine was
but a jest.  If it does not hold good now, it will when thou takest the
road again.  Cousin,'--this to the poor relation, never wearied of
extolling her patroness's charity--'he is getting a bloom on the skin
of a new-curried horse.  Our work is like polishing jewels to be thrown
to a dance-girl--eh?'

Kim sat up and smiled.  The terrible weakness had dropped from him like
an old shoe.  His tongue itched for free speech again, and but a week
back the lightest word clogged it like ashes.  The pain in his neck (he
must have caught it from the lama) had gone with the heavy dengue-aches
and the evil taste in the mouth.  The two old women, a little, but not
much, more careful about their veils now, clucked as merrily as the
hens that had entered pecking through the open door.

'Where is my Holy One?'  he demanded.

'Hear him!  Thy Holy One is well,' she snapped viciously.  'Though that
is none of his merit.  Knew I a charm to make him wise, I'd sell my
jewels and buy it.  To refuse good food that I cooked myself--and go
roving into the fields for two nights on an empty belly--and to tumble
into a brook at the end of it--call you that holiness?  Then, when he
has nearly broken what thou hast left of my heart with anxiety, he
tells me that he has acquired merit.  Oh, how like are all men!  No,
that was not it--he tells me that he is freed from all sin.  I could
have told him that before he wetted himself all over.  He is well
now--this happened a week ago--but burn me such holiness!  A babe of
three would do better.  Do not fret thyself for the Holy One.  He keeps
both eyes on thee when he is not wading our brooks.'

'I do not remember to have seen him.  I remember that the days and
nights passed like bars of white and black, opening and shutting.  I
was not sick:  I was but tired.'

'A lethargy that comes by right some few score years later.  But it is
done now.'

'Maharanee,' Kim began, but led by the look in her eye, changed it to
the title of plain love--'Mother, I owe my life to thee.  How shall I
make thanks?  Ten thousand blessings upon thy house and--'

'The house be unblessed!'  (It is impossible to give exactly the old
lady's word.) 'Thank the Gods as a priest if thou wilt, but thank me,
if thou carest, as a son.  Heavens above!  Have I shifted thee and
lifted thee and slapped and twisted thy ten toes to find texts flung at
my head?  Somewhere a mother must have borne thee to break her heart.
What used thou to her--son?'

'I had no mother, my mother,' said Kim.  'She died, they tell me, when
I was young.'

'Hai mai!  Then none can say I have robbed her of any right if--when
thou takest the road again and this house is but one of a thousand used
for shelter and forgotten, after an easy-flung blessing.  No matter.  I
need no blessings, but--but--' She stamped her foot at the poor
relation.  'Take up the trays to the house.  What is the good of stale
food in the room, O woman of ill-omen?'

'I ha--have borne a son in my time too, but he died,' whimpered the
bowed sister-figure behind the chudder.  'Thou knowest he died!  I only
waited for the order to take away the tray.'

'It is I that am the woman of ill-omen,' cried the old lady penitently.
'We that go down to the chattris [the big umbrellas above the
burning-ghats where the priests take their last dues] clutch hard at
the bearers of the chattis [water-jars--young folk full of the pride of
life, she meant; but the pun is clumsy].  When one cannot dance in the
festival one must e'en look out of the window, and grandmothering takes
all a woman's time.  Thy master gives me all the charms I now desire
for my daughter's eldest, by reason--is it?--that he is wholly free
from sin.  The hakim is brought very low these days.  He goes about
poisoning my servants for lack of their betters.'

'What hakim, mother?'

'That very Dacca man who gave me the pill which rent me in three
pieces.  He cast up like a strayed camel a week ago, vowing that he and
thou had been blood-brothers together up Kulu-way, and feigning great
anxiety for thy health.  He was very thin and hungry, so I gave orders
to have him stuffed too--him and his anxiety!'

'I would see him if he is here.'

'He eats five times a day, and lances boils for my hinds to save
himself from an apoplexy.  He is so full of anxiety for thy health that
he sticks to the cook-house door and stays himself with scraps. He will
keep.  We shall never get rid of him.'

'Send him here, mother'--the twinkle returned to Kim's eye for a
flash--'and I will try.'

'I'll send him, but to chase him off is an ill turn.  At least he had
the sense to fish the Holy One out of the brook; thus, as the Holy One
did not say, acquiring merit.'

'He is a very wise hakim.  Send him, mother.'

'Priest praising priest?  A miracle!  If he is any friend of thine (ye
squabbled at your last meeting) I'll hale him here with horse-ropes
and--and give him a caste-dinner afterwards, my son ...  Get up and see
the world!  This lying abed is the mother of seventy devils ... my son!
my son!'

She trotted forth to raise a typhoon off the cook-house, and almost on
her shadow rolled in the Babu, robed as to the shoulders like a Roman
emperor, jowled like Titus, bare-headed, with new patent-leather shoes,
in highest condition of fat, exuding joy and salutations.

'By Jove, Mister O'Hara, but I are jolly-glad to see you.  I will
kindly shut the door.  It is a pity you are sick.  Are you very sick?'

'The papers--the papers from the kilta.  The maps and the murasla!' He
held out the key impatiently; for the present need on his soul was to
get rid of the loot.

'You are quite right.  That is correct Departmental view to take.  You
have got everything?'

'All that was handwritten in the kilta I took.  The rest I threw down
the hill.'  He could hear the key's grate in the lock, the sticky pull
of the slow-rending oilskin, and a quick shuffling of papers. He had
been annoyed out of all reason by the knowledge that they lay below him
through the sick idle days--a burden incommunicable.  For that reason
the blood tingled through his body, when Hurree, skipping
elephantinely, shook hands again.

'This is fine!  This is finest!  Mister O'Hara!  you have--ha!  ha!
swiped the whole bag of tricks--locks, stocks, and barrels.  They told
me it was eight months' work gone up the spouts!  By Jove, how they
beat me!  ...  Look, here is the letter from Hilas!'  He intoned a line
or two of Court Persian, which is the language of authorized and
unauthorized diplomacy.  'Mister Rajah Sahib has just about put his
foot in the holes.  He will have to explain offeecially how the
deuce-an'-all he is writing love-letters to the Czar.  And they are
very clever maps ...  and there is three or four Prime Ministers of
these parts implicated by the correspondence.  By Gad, sar!  The
British Government will change the succession in Hilas and Bunar, and
nominate new heirs to the throne.  "Trea-son most base" ...  but you do
not understand?  Eh?'

'Are they in thy hands?'  said Kim.  It was all he cared for.

'Just you jolly-well bet yourself they are.'  He stowed the entire
trove about his body, as only Orientals can.  'They are going up to the
office, too.  The old lady thinks I am permanent fixture here, but I
shall go away with these straight off--immediately.  Mr Lurgan will be
proud man.  You are offeecially subordinate to me, but I shall embody
your name in my verbal report.  It is a pity we are not allowed written
reports.  We Bengalis excel in thee exact science.' He tossed back the
key and showed the box empty.

'Good.  That is good.  I was very tired.  My Holy One was sick, too.
And did he fall into--'

'Oah yess.  I am his good friend, I tell you.  He was behaving very
strange when I came down after you, and I thought perhaps he might have
the papers.  I followed him on his meditations, and to discuss
ethnological points also.  You see, I am verree small person here
nowadays, in comparison with all his charms.  By Jove, O'Hara, do you
know, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits.  Yess, I tell you.
Cataleptic, too, if not also epileptic.  I found him in such a state
under a tree in articulo mortem, and he jumped up and walked into a
brook and he was nearly drowned but for me.  I pulled him out.'

'Because I was not there!'  said Kim.  'He might have died.'

'Yes, he might have died, but he is dry now, and asserts he has
undergone transfiguration.'  The Babu tapped his forehead knowingly. 'I
took notes of his statements for Royal Society--in posse.  You must
make haste and be quite well and come back to Simla, and I will tell
you all my tale at Lurgan's.  It was splendid.  The bottoms of their
trousers were quite torn, and old Nahan Rajah, he thought they were
European soldiers deserting.'

'Oh, the Russians?  How long were they with thee?'

'One was a Frenchman.  Oh, days and days and days!  Now all the
hill-people believe all Russians are all beggars.  By Jove! they had
not one dam'-thing that I did not get them.  And I told the common
people--oah, such tales and anecdotes!--I will tell you at old Lurgan's
when you come up.  We will have--ah--a night out!  It is feather in
both our caps!  Yess, and they gave me a certificate.  That is creaming
joke.  You should have seen them at the Alliance Bank identifying
themselves!  And thank Almighty God you got their papers so well!  You
do not laugh verree much, but you shall laugh when you are well.  Now I
will go straight to the railway and get out.  You shall have all sorts
of credits for your game.  When do you come along?  We are very proud
of you though you gave us great frights. And especially Mahbub.'

'Ay, Mahbub.  And where is he?'

'Selling horses in this vi-cinity, of course.'

'Here!  Why?  Speak slowly.  There is a thickness in my head still.'

The Babu looked shyly down his nose.  'Well, you see, I am fearful man,
and I do not like responsibility.  You were sick, you see, and I did
not know where deuce-an'-all the papers were, and if so, how many.  So
when I had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub--he was
at Meerut for races--and I tell him how case stands.  He comes up with
his men and he consorts with the lama, and then he calls me a fool, and
is very rude--'

'But wherefore--wherefore?'

'That is what I ask.  I only suggest that if anyone steals the papers I
should like some good strong, brave men to rob them back again. You
see, they are vitally important, and Mahbub Ali he did not know where
you were.'

'Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba's house?  Thou art mad, Babu,' said Kim
with indignation.

'I wanted the papers.  Suppose she had stole them?  It was only
practical suggestion, I think.  You are not pleased, eh?'

A native proverb--unquotable--showed the blackness of Kim's disapproval.

'Well,'--Hurree shrugged his shoulders--'there is no accounting for
thee taste.  Mahbub was angry too.  He has sold horses all about here,
and he says old lady is pukka [thorough] old lady and would not
condescend to such ungentlemanly things.  I do not care.  I have got
the papers, and I was very glad of moral support from Mahbub.  I tell
you, I am fearful man, but, somehow or other, the more fearful I am the
more dam'-tight places I get into.  So I was glad you came with me to
Chini, and I am glad Mahbub was close by.  The old lady she is
sometimes very rude to me and my beautiful pills.'

'Allah be merciful!'  said Kim on his elbow, rejoicing.  'What a beast
of wonder is a Babu!  And that man walked alone--if he did walk--with
robbed and angry foreigners!'

'Oah, thatt was nothing, after they had done beating me; but if I lost
the papers it was pretty-jolly serious.  Mahbub he nearly beat me too,
and he went and consorted with the lama no end.  I shall stick to
ethnological investigations henceforwards.  Now good-bye, Mister
O'Hara.  I can catch 4.25 p.m.  to Umballa if I am quick.  It will be
good times when we all tell thee tale up at Mr Lurgan's.  I shall
report you offeecially better.  Good-bye, my dear fallow, and when next
you are under thee emotions please do not use the Mohammedan terms with
the Tibetan dress.'

He shook hands twice--a Babu to his boot-heels--and opened the door.
With the fall of the sunlight upon his still triumphant face he
returned to the humble Dacca quack.

'He robbed them,' thought Kim, forgetting his own share in the game.
'He tricked them.  He lied to them like a Bengali.  They give him a
chit [a testimonial].  He makes them a mock at the risk of his life--I
never would have gone down to them after the pistol-shots--and then he
says he is a fearful man ...  And he is a fearful man.  I must get into
the world again.'

At first his legs bent like bad pipe-stems, and the flood and rush of
the sunlit air dazzled him.  He squatted by the white wall, the mind
rummaging among the incidents of the long dooli journey, the lama's
weaknesses, and, now that the stimulus of talk was removed, his own
self-pity, of which, like the sick, he had great store.  The unnerved
brain edged away from all the outside, as a raw horse, once rowelled,
sidles from the spur.  It was enough, amply enough, that the spoil of
the kilta was away--off his hands--out of his possession.  He tried to
think of the lama--to wonder why he had tumbled into a brook--but the
bigness of the world, seen between the forecourt gates, swept linked
thought aside.  Then he looked upon the trees and the broad fields,
with the thatched huts hidden among crops--looked with strange eyes
unable to take up the size and proportion and use of things--stared for
a still half-hour.  All that while he felt, though he could not put it
into words, that his soul was out of gear with its surroundings--a
cog-wheel unconnected with any machinery, just like the idle cog-wheel
of a cheap Beheea sugar-crusher laid by in a corner.  The breezes
fanned over him, the parrots shrieked at him, the noises of the
populated house behind--squabbles, orders, and reproofs--hit on dead
ears.

'I am Kim.  I am Kim.  And what is Kim?'  His soul repeated it again
and again.

He did not want to cry--had never felt less like crying in his
life--but of a sudden easy, stupid tears trickled down his nose, and
with an almost audible click he felt the wheels of his being lock up
anew on the world without.  Things that rode meaningless on the eyeball
an instant before slid into proper proportion.  Roads were meant to be
walked upon, houses to be lived in, cattle to be driven, fields to be
tilled, and men and women to be talked to.  They were all real and
true--solidly planted upon the feet--perfectly comprehensible--clay of
his clay, neither more nor less.  He shook himself like a dog with a
flea in his ear, and rambled out of the gate.  Said the Sahiba, to whom
watchful eyes reported this move: 'Let him go.  I have done my share.
Mother Earth must do the rest. When the Holy One comes back from
meditation, tell him.'

There stood an empty bullock-cart on a little knoll half a mile away,
with a young banyan tree behind--a look-out, as it were, above some
new-ploughed levels; and his eyelids, bathed in soft air, grew heavy as
he neared it.  The ground was good clean dust--no new herbage that,
living, is half-way to death already, but the hopeful dust that holds
the seeds of all life.  He felt it between his toes, patted it with his
palms, and joint by joint, sighing luxuriously, laid him down full
length along in the shadow of the wooden-pinned cart.  And Mother Earth
was as faithful as the Sahiba.  She breathed through him to restore the
poise he had lost lying so long on a cot cut off from her good
currents.  His head lay powerless upon her breast, and his opened hands
surrendered to her strength.  The many-rooted tree above him, and even
the dead manhandled wood beside, knew what he sought, as he himself did
not know.  Hour upon hour he lay deeper than sleep.

Towards evening, when the dust of returning kine made all the horizons
smoke, came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously,
for the house had told them where he had gone.

'Allah!  What a fool's trick to play in open country!'  muttered the
horse-dealer.  'He could be shot a hundred times--but this is not the
Border.'

'And,' said the lama, repeating a many-times-told tale, 'never was such
a chela.  Temperate, kindly, wise, of ungrudging disposition, a merry
heart upon the road, never forgetting, learned, truthful, courteous.
Great is his reward!'

'I know the boy--as I have said.'

'And he was all those things?'

'Some of them--but I have not yet found a Red Hat's charm for making
him overly truthful.  He has certainly been well nursed.'

'The Sahiba is a heart of gold,' said the lama earnestly.  'She looks
upon him as her son.'

'Hmph!  Half Hind seems that way disposed.  I only wished to see that
the boy had come to no harm and was a free agent.  As thou knowest, he
and I were old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together.'

'That is a bond between us.'  The lama sat down.  'We are at the end of
the pilgrimage.'

'No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back.
I heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot.'
Mahbub laughed, and tugged his newly dyed beard.

'I was meditating upon other matters that tide.  It was the hakim from
Dacca broke my meditations.'

'Otherwise'--this was in Pushtu for decency's sake--'thou wouldst have
ended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hell--being an unbeliever
and an idolater for all thy child's simplicity.  But now, Red Hat, what
is to be done?'

'This very night,'--the words came slowly, vibrating with
triumph--'this very night he will be as free as I am from all taint of
sin--assured as I am, when he quits this body, of Freedom from the
Wheel of Things.  I have a sign'--he laid his hand above the torn chart
in his bosom--'that my time is short; but I shall have safeguarded him
throughout the years.  Remember, I have reached Knowledge, as I told
thee only three nights back.'

'It must be true, as the Tirah priest said when I stole his cousin's
wife, that I am a Sufi [a free-thinker]; for here I sit,' said Mahbub
to himself, 'drinking in blasphemy unthinkable ...  I remember the
tale.  On that, then, he goes to Fannatu l'Adn [the Gardens of Eden].
But how?  Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that wonderful river from
which the Babu dragged thee?'

'I was dragged from no river,' said the lama simply.  'Thou hast
forgotten what befell.  I found it by Knowledge.'

'Oh, ay.  True,' stammered Mahbub, divided between high indignation and
enormous mirth.  'I had forgotten the exact run of what happened. Thou
didst find it knowingly.'

'And to say that I would take life is--not a sin, but a madness simple.
My chela aided me to the River.  It is his right to be cleansed from
sin--with me.'

'Ay, he needs cleansing.  But afterwards, old man--afterwards?'

'What matter under all the Heavens?  He is sure of
Nibban--enlightened--as I am.'

'Well said.  I had a fear he might mount Mohammed's Horse and fly away.'

'Nay--he must go forth as a teacher.'

'Aha!  Now I see!  That is the right gait for the colt.  Certainly he
must go forth as a teacher.  He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe
by the State, for instance.'

'To that end he was prepared.  I acquired merit in that I gave alms for
his sake.  A good deed does not die.  He aided me in my Search.  I
aided him in his.  Just is the Wheel, O horse-seller from the North.
Let him be a teacher; let him be a scribe--what matter?  He will have
attained Freedom at the end.  The rest is illusion.'

'What matter?  When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months!
I come up with ten lame horses and three strong-backed men--thanks to
that chicken of a Babu--to break a sick boy by force out of an old
trot's house.  It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted
into Allah knows what of an idolater's Heaven by means of old Red Hat.
And I am reckoned something of a player of the Game myself!  But the
madman is fond of the boy; and I must be very reasonably mad too.'

'What is the prayer?' said the lama, as the rough Pushtu rumbled into
the red beard.

'No matter at all; but now I understand that the boy, sure of Paradise,
can yet enter Government service, my mind is easier.  I must get to my
horses.  It grows dark.  Do not wake him.  I have no wish to hear him
call thee master.'

'But he is my disciple.  What else?'

'He has told me.'  Mahbub choked down his touch of spleen and rose
laughing.  'I am not altogether of thy faith, Red Hat--if so small a
matter concern thee.'

'It is nothing,' said the lama.

'I thought not.  Therefore it will not move thee, sinless, new-washed
and three parts drowned to boot, when I call thee a good man--a very
good man.  We have talked together some four or five evenings now, and
for all I am a horse-coper I can still, as the saying is, see holiness
beyond the legs of a horse.  Yea, can see, too, how our Friend of all
the World put his hand in thine at the first.  Use him well, and suffer
him to return to the world as a teacher, when thou hast--bathed his
legs, if that be the proper medicine for the colt.'

'Why not follow the Way thyself, and so accompany the boy?'

Mahbub stared stupefied at the magnificent insolence of the demand,
which across the Border he would have paid with more than a blow. Then
the humour of it touched his worldly soul.

'Softly--softly--one foot at a time, as the lame gelding went over the
Umballa jumps.  I may come to Paradise later--I have workings that
way--great motions--and I owe them to thy simplicity.  Thou hast never
lied?'

'What need?'

'O Allah, hear him!  "What need" in this Thy world!  Nor ever harmed a
man?'

'Once--with a pencase--before I was wise.'

'So?  I think the better of thee.  Thy teachings are good.  Thou hast
turned one man that I know from the path of strife.'  He laughed
immensely.  'He came here open-minded to commit a dacoity [a
house-robbery with violence].  Yes, to cut, rob, kill, and carry off
what he desired.'

'A great foolishness!'

'Oh!  black shame too.  So he thought after he had seen thee--and a few
others, male and female.  So he abandoned it; and now he goes to beat a
big fat Babu man.'

'I do not understand.'

'Allah forbid it!  Some men are strong in knowledge, Red Hat.  Thy
strength is stronger still.  Keep it--I think thou wilt.  If the boy be
not a good servant, pull his ears off.'

With a hitch of his broad Bokhariot belt the Pathan swaggered off into
the gloaming, and the lama came down from his clouds so far as to look
at the broad back.

'That person lacks courtesy, and is deceived by the shadow of
appearances.  But he spoke well of my chela, who now enters upon his
reward.  Let me make the prayer!  ...  Wake, O fortunate above all born
of women.  Wake!  It is found!'

Kim came up from those deep wells, and the lama attended his yawning
pleasure; duly snapping fingers to head off evil spirits.

'I have slept a hundred years.  Where--?  Holy One, hast thou been here
long?  I went out to look for thee, but'--he laughed drowsily--'I slept
by the way.  I am all well now.  Hast thou eaten?  Let us go to the
house.  It is many days since I tended thee.  And the Sahiba fed thee
well?  Who shampooed thy legs?  What of the weaknesses--the belly and
the neck, and the beating in the ears?'

'Gone--all gone.  Dost thou not know?'

'I know nothing, but that I have not seen thee in a monkey's age. Know
what?'

'Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee, when all my thoughts
were theeward.'

'I cannot see the face, but the voice is like a gong.  Has the Sahiba
made a young man of thee by her cookery?'

He peered at the cross-legged figure, outlined jet-black against the
lemon-coloured drift of light.  So does the stone Bodhisat sit who
looks down upon the patent self-registering turnstiles of the Lahore
Museum.

The lama held his peace.  Except for the click of the rosary and a
faint clop-clop of Mahbub's retreating feet, the soft, smoky silence of
evening in India wrapped them close.

'Hear me!  I bring news.'

'But let us--'

Out shot the long yellow hand compelling silence.  Kim tucked his feet
under his robe-edge obediently.

'Hear me!  I bring news!  The Search is finished.  Comes now the
Reward... Thus.  When we were among the Hills, I lived on thy strength
till the young branch bowed and nigh broke.  When we came out of the
Hills, I was troubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my
heart.  The boat of my soul lacked direction; I could not see into the
Cause of Things.  So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether.
I took no food.  I drank no water.  Still I saw not the Way.  They
pressed food upon me and cried at my shut door.  So I removed myself to
a hollow under a tree.  I took no food.  I took no water.  I sat in
meditation two days and two nights, abstracting my mind; inbreathing
and outbreathing in the required manner ...  Upon the second night--so
great was my reward--the wise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body
and went free.  This I have never before attained, though I have stood
on the threshold of it.  Consider, for it is a marvel!'

'A marvel indeed.  Two days and two nights without food!  Where was the
Sahiba?'  said Kim under his breath.

'Yea, my Soul went free, and, wheeling like an eagle, saw indeed that
there was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul.  As a drop draws to water,
so my Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all things.  At
that point, exalted in contemplation, I saw all Hind, from Ceylon in
the sea to the Hills, and my own Painted Rocks at Such-zen; I saw every
camp and village, to the least, where we have ever rested.  I saw them
at one time and in one place; for they were within the Soul.  By this I
knew the Soul had passed beyond the illusion of Time and Space and of
Things.  By this I knew that I was free.  I saw thee lying in thy cot,
and I saw thee falling downhill under the idolater--at one time, in one
place, in my Soul, which, as I say, had touched the Great Soul.  Also I
saw the stupid body of Teshoo Lama lying down, and the hakim from Dacca
kneeled beside, shouting in its ear.  Then my Soul was all alone, and I
saw nothing, for I was all things, having reached the Great Soul.  And
I meditated a thousand thousand years, passionless, well aware of the
Causes of all Things.  Then a voice cried:  "What shall come to the boy
if thou art dead?"  and I was shaken back and forth in myself with pity
for thee; and I said:  "I will return to my chela, lest he miss the
Way." Upon this my Soul, which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama, withdrew
itself from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings
and agonies not to be told.  As the egg from the fish, as the fish from
the water, as the water from the cloud, as the cloud from the thick
air, so put forth, so leaped out, so drew away, so fumed up the Soul of
Teshoo Lama from the Great Soul.  Then a voice cried:  "The River! Take
heed to the River!" and I looked down upon all the world, which was as
I had seen it before--one in time, one in place--and I saw plainly the
River of the Arrow at my feet.  At that hour my Soul was hampered by
some evil or other whereof I was not wholly cleansed, and it lay upon
my arms and coiled round my waist; but I put it aside, and I cast forth
as an eagle in my flight for the very place of the River.  I pushed
aside world upon world for thy sake.  I saw the River below me--the
River of the Arrow--and, descending, the waters of it closed over me;
and behold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama, but free from sin,
and the hakim from Decca bore up my head in the waters of the River.
It is here!  It is behind the mango-tope here--even here!'

'Allah kerim!  Oh, well that the Babu was by!  Wast thou very wet?'

'Why should I regard?  I remember the hakim was concerned for the body
of Teshoo Lama.  He haled it out of the holy water in his hands, and
there came afterwards thy horse-seller from the North with a cot and
men, and they put the body on the cot and bore it up to the Sahiba's
house.'

'What said the Sahiba?'

'I was meditating in that body, and did not hear.  So thus the Search
is ended.  For the merit that I have acquired, the River of the Arrow
is here.  It broke forth at our feet, as I have said.  I have found it.
Son of my Soul, I have wrenched my Soul back from the Threshold of
Freedom to free thee from all sin--as I am free, and sinless! Just is
the Wheel!  Certain is our deliverance!  Come!'

He crossed his hands on his lap and smiled, as a man may who has won
salvation for himself and his beloved.

HOW FEAR CAME

     The stream is shrunk--the pool is dry,
     And we be comrades, thou and I;
     With fevered jowl and dusty flank
     Each jostling each along the bank;
     And by one drouthy fear made still,
     Forgoing thought of quest or kill.
     Now ‘neath his dam the fawn may see,
     The lean Pack-wolf as cowed as he,
     And the tall buck, unflinching, note
     The fangs that tore his father’s throat.
     The pools are shrunk--the streams are dry,
     And we be playmates, thou and I,
     Till yonder cloud--Good Hunting!--loose
     The rain that breaks our Water Truce.

The Law of the Jungle--which is by far the oldest law in the world--has
arranged for almost every kind of accident that may befall the Jungle
People, till now its code is as perfect as time and custom can make
it. You will remember that Mowgli spent a great part of his life in the
Seeonee Wolf-Pack, learning the Law from Baloo, the Brown Bear; and
it was Baloo who told him, when the boy grew impatient at the constant
orders, that the Law was like the Giant Creeper, because it dropped
across every one’s back and no one could escape. “When thou hast lived
as long as I have, Little Brother, thou wilt see how all the Jungle
obeys at least one Law. And that will be no pleasant sight,” said Baloo.

This talk went in at one ear and out at the other, for a boy who spends
his life eating and sleeping does not worry about anything till it
actually stares him in the face. But, one year, Baloo’s words came true,
and Mowgli saw all the Jungle working under the Law.

It began when the winter Rains failed almost entirely, and Ikki, the
Porcupine, meeting Mowgli in a bamboo-thicket, told him that the wild
yams were drying up. Now everybody knows that Ikki is ridiculously
fastidious in his choice of food, and will eat nothing but the very best
and ripest. So Mowgli laughed and said, “What is that to me?”

“Not much NOW,” said Ikki, rattling his quills in a stiff, uncomfortable
way, “but later we shall see. Is there any more diving into the deep
rock-pool below the Bee-Rocks, Little Brother?”

“No. The foolish water is going all away, and I do not wish to break my
head,” said Mowgli, who, in those days, was quite sure that he knew as
much as any five of the Jungle People put together.

“That is thy loss. A small crack might let in some wisdom.” Ikki ducked
quickly to prevent Mowgli from pulling his nose-bristles, and Mowgli
told Baloo what Ikki had said. Baloo looked very grave, and mumbled
half to himself: “If I were alone I would change my hunting-grounds now,
before the others began to think. And yet--hunting among strangers ends
in fighting; and they might hurt the Man-cub. We must wait and see how
the mohwa blooms.”

That spring the mohwa tree, that Baloo was so fond of, never flowered.
The greeny, cream-coloured, waxy blossoms were heat-killed before they
were born, and only a few bad-smelling petals came down when he stood
on his hind legs and shook the tree. Then, inch by inch, the untempered
heat crept into the heart of the Jungle, turning it yellow, brown, and
at last black. The green growths in the sides of the ravines burned up
to broken wires and curled films of dead stuff; the hidden pools sank
down and caked over, keeping the last least footmark on their edges as
if it had been cast in iron; the juicy-stemmed creepers fell away from
the trees they clung to and died at their feet; the bamboos withered,
clanking when the hot winds blew, and the moss peeled off the rocks deep
in the Jungle, till they were as bare and as hot as the quivering blue
boulders in the bed of the stream.

The birds and the monkey-people went north early in the year, for they
knew what was coming; and the deer and the wild pig broke far away to
the perished fields of the villages, dying sometimes before the eyes
of men too weak to kill them. Chil, the Kite, stayed and grew fat, for
there was a great deal of carrion, and evening after evening he
brought the news to the beasts, too weak to force their way to fresh
hunting-grounds, that the sun was killing the Jungle for three days’
flight in every direction.

Mowgli, who had never known what real hunger meant, fell back on stale
honey, three years old, scraped out of deserted rock-hives--honey black
as a sloe, and dusty with dried sugar. He hunted, too, for deep-boring
grubs under the bark of the trees, and robbed the wasps of their new
broods. All the game in the jungle was no more than skin and bone, and
Bagheera could kill thrice in a night, and hardly get a full meal. But
the want of water was the worst, for though the Jungle People drink
seldom they must drink deep.

And the heat went on and on, and sucked up all the moisture, till at
last the main channel of the Waingunga was the only stream that carried
a trickle of water between its dead banks; and when Hathi, the wild
elephant, who lives for a hundred years and more, saw a long, lean blue
ridge of rock show dry in the very centre of the stream, he knew that he
was looking at the Peace Rock, and then and there he lifted up his trunk
and proclaimed the Water Truce, as his father before him had proclaimed
it fifty years ago. The deer, wild pig, and buffalo took up the cry
hoarsely; and Chil, the Kite, flew in great circles far and wide,
whistling and shrieking the warning.

By the Law of the Jungle it is death to kill at the drinking-places
when once the Water Truce has been declared. The reason of this is that
drinking comes before eating. Every one in the Jungle can scramble along
somehow when only game is scarce; but water is water, and when there is
but one source of supply, all hunting stops while the Jungle People go
there for their needs. In good seasons, when water was plentiful, those
who came down to drink at the Waingunga--or anywhere else, for that
matter--did so at the risk of their lives, and that risk made no small
part of the fascination of the night’s doings. To move down so cunningly
that never a leaf stirred; to wade knee-deep in the roaring shallows
that drown all noise from behind; to drink, looking backward over one
shoulder, every muscle ready for the first desperate bound of keen
terror; to roll on the sandy margin, and return, wet-muzzled and well
plumped out, to the admiring herd, was a thing that all tall-antlered
young bucks took a delight in, precisely because they knew that at any
moment Bagheera or Shere Khan might leap upon them and bear them down.
But now all that life-and-death fun was ended, and the Jungle People
came up, starved and weary, to the shrunken river,--tiger, bear, deer,
buffalo, and pig, all together,--drank the fouled waters, and hung above
them, too exhausted to move off.

The deer and the pig had tramped all day in search of something better
than dried bark and withered leaves. The buffaloes had found no wallows
to be cool in, and no green crops to steal. The snakes had left the
Jungle and come down to the river in the hope of finding a stray frog.
They curled round wet stones, and never offered to strike when the nose
of a rooting pig dislodged them. The river-turtles had long ago been
killed by Bagheera, cleverest of hunters, and the fish had buried
themselves deep in the dry mud. Only the Peace Rock lay across the
shallows like a long snake, and the little tired ripples hissed as they
dried on its hot side.

It was here that Mowgli came nightly for the cool and the companionship.
The most hungry of his enemies would hardly have cared for the boy then,
His naked hide made him seem more lean and wretched than any of his
fellows. His hair was bleached to tow colour by the sun; his ribs stood
out like the ribs of a basket, and the lumps on his knees and elbows,
where he was used to track on all fours, gave his shrunken limbs the
look of knotted grass-stems. But his eye, under his matted forelock, was
cool and quiet, for Bagheera was his adviser in this time of trouble,
and told him to go quietly, hunt slowly, and never, on any account, to
lose his temper.

“It is an evil time,” said the Black Panther, one furnace-hot evening,
“but it will go if we can live till the end. Is thy stomach full,
Man-cub?”

“There is stuff in my stomach, but I get no good of it. Think you,
Bagheera, the Rains have forgotten us and will never come again?”

“Not I! We shall see the mohwa in blossom yet, and the little fawns all
fat with new grass. Come down to the Peace Rock and hear the news. On my
back, Little Brother.”

“This is no time to carry weight. I can still stand alone, but--indeed
we be no fatted bullocks, we two.”

Bagheera looked along his ragged, dusty flank and whispered. “Last night
I killed a bullock under the yoke. So low was I brought that I think I
should not have dared to spring if he had been loose. WOU!”

Mowgli laughed. “Yes, we be great hunters now,” said he. “I am very
bold--to eat grubs,” and the two came down together through the
crackling undergrowth to the river-bank and the lace-work of shoals that
ran out from it in every direction.

“The water cannot live long,” said Baloo, joining them. “Look across.
Yonder are trails like the roads of Man.”

On the level plain of the farther bank the stiff jungle-grass had died
standing, and, dying, had mummied. The beaten tracks of the deer and
the pig, all heading toward the river, had striped that colourless plain
with dusty gullies driven through the ten-foot grass, and, early as it
was, each long avenue was full of first-comers hastening to the water.
You could hear the does and fawns coughing in the snuff-like dust.

Up-stream, at the bend of the sluggish pool round the Peace Rock, and
Warden of the Water Truce, stood Hathi, the wild elephant, with his
sons, gaunt and gray in the moonlight, rocking to and fro--always
rocking. Below him a little were the vanguard of the deer; below these,
again, the pig and the wild buffalo; and on the opposite bank, where the
tall trees came down to the water’s edge, was the place set apart for
the Eaters of Flesh--the tiger, the wolves, the panther, the bear, and
the others.

“We are under one Law, indeed,” said Bagheera, wading into the water and
looking across at the lines of clicking horns and starting eyes where
the deer and the pig pushed each other to and fro. “Good hunting, all
you of my blood,” he added, lying own at full length, one flank thrust
out of the shallows; and then, between his teeth, “But for that which is
the Law it would be VERY good hunting.”

The quick-spread ears of the deer caught the last sentence, and a
frightened whisper ran along the ranks. “The Truce! Remember the Truce!”

“Peace there, peace!” gurgled Hathi, the wild elephant. “The Truce
holds, Bagheera. This is no time to talk of hunting.”

“Who should know better than I?” Bagheera answered, rolling his yellow
eyes up-stream. “I am an eater of turtles--a fisher of frogs. Ngaayah!
Would I could get good from chewing branches!”

“WE wish so, very greatly,” bleated a young fawn, who had only been born
that spring, and did not at all like it. Wretched as the Jungle People
were, even Hathi could not help chuckling; while Mowgli, lying on his
elbows in the warm water, laughed aloud, and beat up the scum with his
feet.

“Well spoken, little bud-horn,” Bagheera purred. “When the Truce ends
that shall be remembered in thy favour,” and he looked keenly through
the darkness to make sure of recognising the fawn again.

Gradually the talking spread up and down the drinking-places. One could
hear the scuffling, snorting pig asking for more room; the buffaloes
grunting among themselves as they lurched out across the sand-bars, and
the deer telling pitiful stories of their long foot-sore wanderings in
quest of food. Now and again they asked some question of the Eaters of
Flesh across the river, but all the news was bad, and the roaring hot
wind of the Jungle came and went between the rocks and the rattling
branches, and scattered twigs, and dust on the water.

“The men-folk, too, they die beside their ploughs,” said a young
sambhur. “I passed three between sunset and night. They lay still, and
their Bullocks with them. We also shall lie still in a little.”

“The river has fallen since last night,” said Baloo. “O Hathi, hast thou
ever seen the like of this drought?”

“It will pass, it will pass,” said Hathi, squirting water along his back
and sides.

“We have one here that cannot endure long,” said Baloo; and he looked
toward the boy he loved.

“I?” said Mowgli indignantly, sitting up in the water. “I have no long
fur to cover my bones, but--but if THY hide were taken off, Baloo----”

Hathi shook all over at the idea, and Baloo said severely:

“Man-cub, that is not seemly to tell a Teacher of the Law. Never have I
been seen without my hide.”

“Nay, I meant no harm, Baloo; but only that thou art, as it were, like
the cocoanut in the husk, and I am the same cocoanut all naked. Now that
brown husk of thine----” Mowgli was sitting cross-legged, and explaining
things with his forefinger in his usual way, when Bagheera put out a
paddy paw and pulled him over backward into the water.

“Worse and worse,” said the Black Panther, as the boy rose spluttering.
“First Baloo is to be skinned, and now he is a cocoanut. Be careful that
he does not do what the ripe cocoanuts do.”

“And what is that?” said Mowgli, off his guard for the minute, though
that is one of the oldest catches in the Jungle.

“Break thy head,” said Bagheera quietly, pulling him under again.

“It is not good to make a jest of thy teacher,” said the bear, when
Mowgli had been ducked for the third time.

“Not good! What would ye have? That naked thing running to and fro makes
a monkey-jest of those who have once been good hunters, and pulls the
best of us by the whiskers for sport.” This was Shere Khan, the Lame
Tiger, limping down to the water. He waited a little to enjoy the
sensation he made among the deer on the opposite to lap, growling: “The
jungle has become a whelping-ground for naked cubs now. Look at me,
Man-cub!”

Mowgli looked--stared, rather--as insolently as he knew how, and in
a minute Shere Khan turned away uneasily. “Man-cub this, and Man-cub
that,” he rumbled, going on with his drink, “the cub is neither man nor
cub, or he would have been afraid. Next season I shall have to beg his
leave for a drink. Augrh!”

“That may come, too,” said Bagheera, looking him steadily between the
eyes. “That may come, too--Faugh, Shere Khan!--what new shame hast thou
brought here?”

The Lame Tiger had dipped his chin and jowl in the water, and dark, oily
streaks were floating from it down-stream.

“Man!” said Shere Khan coolly, “I killed an hour since.” He went on
purring and growling to himself.

The line of beasts shook and wavered to and fro, and a whisper went
up that grew to a cry. “Man! Man! He has killed Man!” Then all looked
towards Hathi, the wild elephant, but he seemed not to hear. Hathi never
does anything till the time comes, and that is one of the reasons why he
lives so long.

“At such a season as this to kill Man! Was no other game afoot?” said
Bagheera scornfully, drawing himself out of the tainted water, and
shaking each paw, cat-fashion, as he did so.

“I killed for choice--not for food.” The horrified whisper began again,
and Hathi’s watchful little white eye cocked itself in Shere Khan’s
direction. “For choice,” Shere Khan drawled. “Now come I to drink and
make me clean again. Is there any to forbid?”

Bagheera’s back began to curve like a bamboo in a high wind, but Hathi
lifted up his trunk and spoke quietly.

“Thy kill was from choice?” he asked; and when Hathi asks a question it
is best to answer.

“Even so. It was my right and my Night. Thou knowest, O Hathi.” Shere
Khan spoke almost courteously.

“Yes, I know,” Hathi answered; and, after a little silence, “Hast thou
drunk thy fill?”

“For to-night, yes.”

“Go, then. The river is to drink, and not to defile. None but the Lame
Tiger would so have boasted of his right at this season when--when we
suffer together--Man and Jungle People alike. Clean or unclean, get to
thy lair, Shere Khan!”

The last words rang out like silver trumpets, and Hathi’s three sons
rolled forward half a pace, though there was no need. Shere Khan slunk
away, not daring to growl, for he knew--what every one else knows--that
when the last comes to the last, Hathi is the Master of the Jungle.

“What is this right Shere Khan speaks of?” Mowgli whispered in
Bagheera’s ear. “To kill Man is always, shameful. The Law says so. And
yet Hathi says----”

“Ask him. I do not know, Little Brother. Right or no right, if Hathi had
not spoken I would have taught that lame butcher his lesson. To come
to the Peace Rock fresh from a kill of Man--and to boast of it--is a
jackal’s trick. Besides, he tainted the good water.”

Mowgli waited for a minute to pick up his courage, because no one cared
to address Hathi directly, and then he cried: “What is Shere Khan’s
right, O Hathi?” Both banks echoed his words, for all the People of the
Jungle are intensely curious, and they had just seen something that none
except Baloo, who looked very thoughtful, seemed to understand.

“It is an old tale,” said Hathi; “a tale older than the Jungle. Keep
silence along the banks and I will tell that tale.”

There was a minute or two of pushing a shouldering among the pigs
and the buffalo, and then the leaders of the herds grunted, one after
another, “We wait,” and Hathi strode forward, till he was nearly
knee-deep in the pool by the Peace Rock. Lean and wrinkled and
yellow-tusked though he was, he looked what the Jungle knew him to
be--their master.

“Ye know, children,” he began, “that of all things ye most fear Man;”
 and there was a mutter of agreement.

“This tale touches thee, Little Brother,” said Bagheera to Mowgli.

“I? I am of the Pack--a hunter of the Free People,” Mowgli answered.
“What have I to do with Man?”

“And ye do not know why ye fear Man?” Hathi went on. “This is the
reason. In the beginning of the Jungle, and none know when that was, we
of the Jungle walked together, having no fear of one another. In those
days there was no drought, and leaves and flowers and fruit grew on the
same tree, and we ate nothing at all except leaves and flowers and grass
and fruit and bark.”

“I am glad I was not born in those days,” said Bagheera. “Bark is only
good to sharpen claws.”

“And the Lord of the Jungle was Tha, the First of the Elephants. He drew
the Jungle out of deep waters with his trunk; and where he made furrows
in the ground with his tusks, there the rivers ran; and where he struck
with his foot, there rose ponds of good water; and when he blew through
his trunk,--thus,--the trees fell. That was the manner in which the
Jungle was made by Tha; and so the tale was told to me.”

“It has not lost fat in the telling,” Bagheera whispered, and Mowgli
laughed behind his hand.

“In those days there was no corn or melons or pepper or sugar-cane,
nor were there any little huts such as ye have all seen; and the Jungle
People knew nothing of Man, but lived in the Jungle together, making
one people. But presently they began to dispute over their food, though
there was grazing enough for all. They were lazy. Each wished to eat
where he lay, as sometimes we can do now when the spring rains are good.
Tha, the First of the Elephants, was busy making new jungles and leading
the rivers in their beds. He could not walk in all places; therefore he
made the First of the Tigers the master and the judge of the Jungle, to
whom the Jungle People should bring their disputes. In those days the
First of the Tigers ate fruit and grass with the others. He was as large
as I am, and he was very beautiful, in colour all over like the blossom
of the yellow creeper. There was never stripe nor bar upon his hide in
those good days when this the Jungle was new. All the Jungle People came
before him without fear, and his word was the Law of all the Jungle. We
were then, remember ye, one people.

“Yet upon a night there was a dispute between two bucks--a
grazing-quarrel such as ye now settle with the horns and the
fore-feet--and it is said that as the two spoke together before the
First of the First of the Tigers lying among the flowers, a buck pushed
him with his horns, and the First of the Tigers forgot that he was the
master and judge of the Jungle, and, leaping upon that buck, broke his
neck.

“Till that night never one of us had died, and the First of the Tigers,
seeing what he had done, and being made foolish by the scent of the
blood, ran away into the marshes of the North, and we of the Jungle,
left without a judge, fell to fighting among ourselves; and Tha heard
the noise of it and came back. Then some of us said this and some of us
said that, but he saw the dead buck among the flowers, and asked who
had killed, and we of the Jungle would not tell because the smell of the
blood made us foolish. We ran to and fro in circles, capering and crying
out and shaking our heads. Then Tha gave an order to the trees that hang
low, and to the trailing creepers of the Jungle, that they should mark
the killer of the buck so that he should know him again, and he said,
‘Who will now be master of the Jungle People?’ Then up leaped the Gray
Ape who lives in the branches, and said, ‘I will now be master of the
Jungle.’”

At this Tha laughed, and said, “So be it,” and went away very angry.

“Children, ye know the Gray Ape. He was then as he is now. At the first
he made a wise face for himself, but in a little while he began to
scratch and to leap up and down, and when Tha came back he found the
Gray Ape hanging, head down, from a bough, mocking those who stood
below; and they mocked him again. And so there was no Law in the
Jungle--only foolish talk and senseless words.

“Then Tha called us all together and said: ‘The first of your masters
has brought Death into the Jungle, and the second Shame. Now it is time
there was a Law, and a Law that ye must not break. Now ye shall know
Fear, and when ye have found him ye shall know that he is your master,
and the rest shall follow.’ Then we of the jungle said, ‘What is Fear?’
And Tha said, ‘Seek till ye find.’ So we went up and down the Jungle
seeking for Fear, and presently the buffaloes----”

“Ugh!” said Mysa, the leader of the buffaloes, from their sand-bank.

“Yes, Mysa, it was the buffaloes. They came back with the news that in a
cave in the Jungle sat Fear, and that he had no hair, and went upon his
hind legs. Then we of the Jungle followed the herd till we came to that
cave, and Fear stood at the mouth of it, and he was, as the buffaloes
had said, hairless, and he walked upon his hinder legs. When he saw us
he cried out, and his voice filled us with the fear that we have now of
that voice when we hear it, and we ran away, tramping upon and tearing
each other because we were afraid. That night, so it was told to me, we
of the Jungle did not lie down together as used to be our custom, but
each tribe drew off by itself--the pig with the pig, the deer with the
deer; horn to horn, hoof to hoof,--like keeping to like, and so lay
shaking in the Jungle.

“Only the First of the Tigers was not with us, for he was still hidden
in the marshes of the North, and when word was brought to him of the
Thing we had seen in the cave, he said. ‘I will go to this Thing and
break his neck.’ So he ran all the night till he came to the cave; but
the trees and the creepers on his path, remembering the order that Tha
had given, let down their branches and marked him as he ran, drawing
their fingers across his back, his flank, his forehead, and his jowl.
Wherever they touched him there was a mark and a stripe upon his yellow
hide. AND THOSE STRIPES DO THIS CHILDREN WEAR TO THIS DAY! When he came
to the cave, Fear, the Hairless One, put out his hand and called him
‘The Striped One that comes by night,’ and the First of the Tigers was
afraid of the Hairless One, and ran back to the swamps howling.”

Mowgli chuckled quietly here, his chin in the water.

“So loud did he howl that Tha heard him and said, ‘What is the sorrow?’
And the First of the Tigers, lifting up his muzzle to the new-made sky,
which is now so old, said: ‘Give me back my power, O Tha. I am made
ashamed before all the Jungle, and I have run away from a Hairless One,
and he has called me a shameful name.’ ‘And why?’ said Tha. ‘Because I
am smeared with the mud of the marshes,’ said the First of the Tigers.
‘Swim, then, and roll on the wet grass, and if it be mud it will wash
away,’ said Tha; and the First of the Tigers swam, and rolled and rolled
upon the grass, till the Jungle ran round and round before his eyes, but
not one little bar upon all his hide was changed, and Tha, watching him,
laughed. Then the First of the Tigers said: ‘What have I done that this
comes to me?’ Tha said, ‘Thou hast killed the buck, and thou hast let
Death loose in the Jungle, and with Death has come Fear, so that the
people of the Jungle are afraid one of the other, as thou art afraid of
the Hairless One.’ The First of the Tigers said, ‘They will never fear
me, for I knew them since the beginning.’ Tha said, ‘Go and see.’ And
the First of the Tigers ran to and fro, calling aloud to the deer and
the pig and the sambhur and the porcupine and all the Jungle Peoples,
and they all ran away from him who had been their judge, because they
were afraid.

“Then the First of the Tigers came back, and his pride was broken in
him, and, beating his head upon the ground, he tore up the earth with
all his feet and said: ‘Remember that I was once the Master of the
Jungle. Do not forget me, O Tha! Let my children remember that I was
once without shame or fear!’ And Tha said: ‘This much I will do, because
thou and I together saw the Jungle made. For one night in each year
it shall be as it was before the buck was killed--for thee and for thy
children. In that one night, if ye meet the Hairless One--and his name
is Man--ye shall not be afraid of him, but he shall be afraid of you, as
though ye were judges of the Jungle and masters of all things. Show him
mercy in that night of his fear, for thou hast known what Fear is.’

“Then the First of the Tigers answered, ‘I am content’; but when next
he drank he saw the black stripes upon his flank and his side, and he
remembered the name that the Hairless One had given him, and he was
angry. For a year he lived in the marshes waiting till Tha should keep
his promise. And upon a night when the jackal of the Moon [the Evening
Star] stood clear of the Jungle, he felt that his Night was upon him,
and he went to that cave to meet the Hairless One. Then it happened as
Tha promised, for the Hairless One fell down before him and lay along
the ground, and the First of the Tigers struck him and broke his back,
for he thought that there was but one such Thing in the Jungle, and that
he had killed Fear. Then, nosing above the kill, he heard Tha coming
down from the woods of the North, and presently the voice of the First
of the Elephants, which is the voice that we hear now----”

The thunder was rolling up and down the dry, scarred hills, but
it brought no rain--only heat--lightning that flickered along the
ridges--and Hathi went on: “THAT was the voice he heard, and it said:
‘Is this thy mercy?’ The First of the Tigers licked his lips and said:
‘What matter? I have killed Fear.’ And Tha said: ‘O blind and foolish!
Thou hast untied the feet of Death, and he will follow thy trail till
thou diest. Thou hast taught Man to kill!’

“The First of the Tigers, standing stiffly to his kill, said. ‘He is as
the buck was. There is no Fear. Now I will judge the Jungle Peoples once
more.’

“And Tha said: ‘Never again shall the Jungle Peoples come to thee. They
shall never cross thy trail, nor sleep near thee, nor follow after thee,
nor browse by thy lair. Only Fear shall follow thee, and with a blow
that thou canst not see he shall bid thee wait his pleasure. He shall
make the ground to open under thy feet, and the creeper to twist about
thy neck, and the tree-trunks to grow together about thee higher than
thou canst leap, and at the last he shall take thy hide to wrap his cubs
when they are cold. Thou hast shown him no mercy, and none will he show
thee.’

“The First of the Tigers was very bold, for his Night was still on him,
and he said: ‘The Promise of Tha is the Promise of Tha. He will not take
away my Night?’ And Tha said: ‘The one Night is thine, as I have said,
but there is a price to pay. Thou hast taught Man to kill, and he is no
slow learner.’

“The First of the Tigers said: ‘He is here under my foot, and his back
is broken. Let the Jungle know I have killed Fear.’

“Then Tha laughed, and said: ‘Thou hast killed one of many, but thou
thyself shalt tell the Jungle--for thy Night is ended.’

“So the day came; and from the mouth of the cave went out another
Hairless One, and he saw the kill in the path, and the First of the
Tigers above it, and he took a pointed stick----”

“They throw a thing that cuts now,” said Ikki, rustling down the bank;
for Ikki was considered uncommonly good eating by the Gonds--they called
him Ho-Igoo--and he knew something of the wicked little Gondee axe that
whirls across a clearing like a dragon-fly.

“It was a pointed stick, such as they put in the foot of a pit-trap,”
 said Hathi, “and throwing it, he struck the First of the Tigers deep in
the flank. Thus it happened as Tha said, for the First of the Tigers ran
howling up and down the Jungle till he tore out the stick, and all the
Jungle knew that the Hairless One could strike from far off, and they
feared more than before. So it came about that the First of the Tigers
taught the Hairless One to kill--and ye know what harm that has since
done to all our peoples--through the noose, and the pitfall, and the
hidden trap, and the flying stick and the stinging fly that comes out of
white smoke [Hathi meant the rifle], and the Red Flower that drives us
into the open. Yet for one night in the year the Hairless One fears the
Tiger, as Tha promised, and never has the Tiger given him cause to be
less afraid. Where he finds him, there he kills him, remembering how the
First of the Tigers was made ashamed. For the rest, Fear walks up and
down the Jungle by day and by night.”

“Ahi! Aoo!” said the deer, thinking of what it all meant to them.

“And only when there is one great Fear over all, as there is now, can we
of the Jungle lay aside our little fears, and meet together in one place
as we do now.”

“For one night only does Man fear the Tiger?” said Mowgli.

“For one night only,” said Hathi.

“But I--but we--but all the Jungle knows that Shere Khan kills Man twice
and thrice in a moon.”

“Even so. THEN he springs from behind and turns his head aside as he
strikes, for he is full of fear. If Man looked at him he would run. But
on his one Night he goes openly down to the village. He walks between
the houses and thrusts his head into the doorway, and the men fall on
their faces, and there he does his kill. One kill in that Night.”

“Oh!” said Mowgli to himself, rolling over in the water. “NOW I see
why it was Shere Khan bade me look at him! He got no good of it, for he
could not hold his eyes steady, and--and I certainly did not fall down
at his feet. But then I am not a man, being of the Free People.”

“Umm!” said Bagheera deep in his furry throat. “Does the Tiger know his
Night?”

“Never till the Jackal of the Moon stands clear of the evening
mist. Sometimes it falls in the dry summer and sometimes in the wet
rains--this one Night of the Tiger. But for the First of the Tigers,
this would never have been, nor would any of us have known fear.”

The deer grunted sorrowfully and Bagheera’s lips curled in a wicked
smile. “Do men know this--tale?” said he.

“None know it except the tigers, and we, the elephants--the children of
Tha. Now ye by the pools have heard it, and I have spoken.”

Hathi dipped his trunk into the water as a sign that he did not wish to
talk.

“But--but--but,” said Mowgli, turning to Baloo, “why did not the First
of the Tigers continue to eat grass and leaves and trees? He did but
break the buck’s neck. He did not EAT. What led him to the hot meat?”

“The trees and the creepers marked him, Little Brother, and made him
the striped thing that we see. Never again would he eat their fruit;
but from that day he revenged himself upon the deer, and the others, the
Eaters of Grass,” said Baloo.

“Then THOU knowest the tale. Heh? Why have I never heard?”

“Because the Jungle is full of such tales. If I made a beginning there
would never be an end to them. Let go my ear, Little Brother.”




THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE

Just to give you an idea of the immense variety of the Jungle Law,
I have translated into verse (Baloo always recited them in a sort of
sing-song) a few of the laws that apply to the wolves. There are, of
course, hundreds and hundreds more, but these will do for specimens of
the simpler rulings.

     Now this is the Law of the Jungle--as old and as true as
        the sky;
     And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf
        that shall break it must die.

     As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth
        forward and back--
     For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength
        of the Wolf is the Pack.

     Wash daily from nose-tip to tail-tip; drink deeply, but
        never too deep;
     And remember the night is for hunting, and forget not
        the day is for sleep.

     The jackal may follow the Tiger, but, Cub, when thy
        whiskers are grown,
     Remember the Wolf is a hunter--go forth and get food
        of thine own.

     Keep peace with the Lords of the Jungle--the Tiger, the
        Panther, the Bear;
     And trouble not Hathi the Silent, and mock not the Boar
        in his lair.

     When Pack meets with Pack in the Jungle, and neither
        will go from the trail,
     Lie down till the leaders have spoken--it may be fair
        words shall prevail.

     When ye fight with a Wolf of the Pack, ye must
        fight him alone and afar,
     Lest others take part in the quarrel, and the Pack be
        diminished by war.

     The Lair of the Wolf is his refuge, and where he has
        made him his home,
     Not even the Head Wolf may enter, not even the Council
        may come.

     The Lair of the Wolf is his refuge, but where he has
        digged it too plain,
     The Council shall send him a message, and so he shall
        change it again.

     If ye kill before midnight, be silent, and wake not the
        woods with your bay,
     Lest ye frighten the deer from the crops, and the brothers
        go empty away.

     Ye may kill for yourselves, and your mates, and your cubs
        as they need, and ye can;
     But kill not for pleasure of killing, and SEVEN TIMES NEVER
        KILL MAN.

     If ye plunder his Kill from a weaker, devour not all in
        thy pride;
     Pack-Right is the right of the meanest; so leave him the
        head and the hide.

     The Kill of the Pack is the meat of the Pack. Ye must
        eat where it lies;
     And no one may carry away of that meat to his lair, or
        he dies.

     The Kill of the Wolf is the meat of the Wolf. He may
        do what he will,
     But, till he has given permission, the Pack may not eat
        of that Kill.

     Cub-Right is the right of the Yearling. From all of his
        Pack he may claim
     Full-gorge when the killer has eaten; and none may
        refuse him the same.

     Lair-Right is the right of the Mother. From all of her
        year she may claim
     One haunch of each kill for her litter, and none may
        deny her the same.

     Cave-Right is the right of the Father--to hunt by himself
        for his own.
     He is freed of all calls to the Pack; he is judged by the
        Council alone.

     Because of his age and his cunning, because of his gripe
        and his paw,
     In all that the Law leaveth open, the word of the Head
        Wolf is Law.

     Now these are the Laws of the Jungle, and many and
        mighty are they;
     But the head and the hoof of the Law and the haunch
        and the hump is--Obey!




THE MIRACLE OF PURUN BHAGAT

     The night we felt the earth would move
       We stole and plucked him by the hand,
     Because we loved him with the love
       That knows but cannot understand.

     And when the roaring hillside broke,
       And all our world fell down in rain,
     We saved him, we the Little Folk;
       But lo! he does not come again!

     Mourn now, we saved him for the sake
       Of such poor love as wild ones may.
     Mourn ye! Our brother will not wake,
       And his own kind drive us away!

                             Dirge of the Langurs.


There was once a man in India who was Prime Minister of one of the
semi-independent native States in the north-western part of the country.
He was a Brahmin, so high-caste that caste ceased to have any particular
meaning for him; and his father had been an important official in the
gay-coloured tag-rag and bobtail of an old-fashioned Hindu Court. But
as Purun Dass grew up he felt that the old order of things was changing,
and that if any one wished to get on in the world he must stand well
with the English, and imitate all that the English believed to be good.
At the same time a native official must keep his own master’s favour.
This was a difficult game, but the quiet, close-mouthed young Brahmin,
helped by a good English education at a Bombay University, played it
coolly, and rose, step by step, to be Prime Minister of the kingdom.
That is to say, he held more real power than his master the Maharajah.

When the old king--who was suspicious of the English, their railways and
telegraphs--died, Purun Dass stood high with his young successor, who
had been tutored by an Englishman; and between them, though he always
took care that his master should have the credit, they established
schools for little girls, made roads, and started State dispensaries and
shows of agricultural implements, and published a yearly blue-book on
the “Moral and Material Progress of the State,” and the Foreign Office
and the Government of India were delighted. Very few native States take
up English progress altogether, for they will not believe, as Purun Dass
showed he did, that what was good for the Englishman must be twice as
good for the Asiatic. The Prime Minister became the honoured friend
of Viceroys, and Governors, and Lieutenant-Governors, and medical
missionaries, and common missionaries, and hard-riding English officers
who came to shoot in the State preserves, as well as of whole hosts of
tourists who travelled up and down India in the cold weather, showing
how things ought to be managed. In his spare time he would endow
scholarships for the study of medicine and manufactures on strictly
English lines, and write letters to the “Pioneer”, the greatest Indian
daily paper, explaining his master’s aims and objects.

At last he went to England on a visit, and had to pay enormous sums to
the priests when he came back; for even so high-caste a Brahmin as Purun
Dass lost caste by crossing the black sea. In London he met and talked
with every one worth knowing--men whose names go all over the world--and
saw a great deal more than he said. He was given honorary degrees by
learned universities, and he made speeches and talked of Hindu social
reform to English ladies in evening dress, till all London cried, “This
is the most fascinating man we have ever met at dinner since cloths were
first laid.”

When he returned to India there was a blaze of glory, for the Viceroy
himself made a special visit to confer upon the Maharajah the Grand
Cross of the Star of India--all diamonds and ribbons and enamel; and at
the same ceremony, while the cannon boomed, Purun Dass was made a Knight
Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire; so that his name stood Sir
Purun Dass, K.C.I.E.

That evening, at dinner in the big Viceregal tent, he stood up with the
badge and the collar of the Order on his breast, and replying to the
toast of his master’s health, made a speech few Englishmen could have
bettered.

Next month, when the city had returned to its sun-baked quiet, he did
a thing no Englishman would have dreamed of doing; for, so far as the
world’s affairs went, he died. The jewelled order of his knighthood went
back to the Indian Government, and a new Prime Minister was appointed to
the charge of affairs, and a great game of General Post began in all the
subordinate appointments. The priests knew what had happened, and the
people guessed; but India is the one place in the world where a man can
do as he pleases and nobody asks why; and the fact that Dewan Sir Purun
Dass, K.C.I.E., had resigned position, palace, and power, and taken up
the begging-bowl and ochre-coloured dress of a Sunnyasi, or holy man,
was considered nothing extraordinary. He had been, as the Old Law
recommends, twenty years a youth, twenty years a fighter,--though he
had never carried a weapon in his life,--and twenty years head of a
household. He had used his wealth and his power for what he knew both to
be worth; he had taken honour when it came his way; he had seen men and
cities far and near, and men and cities had stood up and honoured him.
Now he would let those things go, as a man drops the cloak he no longer
needs.

Behind him, as he walked through the city gates, an antelope skin and
brass-handled crutch under his arm, and a begging-bowl of polished
brown coco-de-mer in his hand, barefoot, alone, with eyes cast on the
ground--behind him they were firing salutes from the bastions in honour
of his happy successor. Purun Dass nodded. All that life was ended;
and he bore it no more ill-will or good-will than a man bears to a
colourless dream of the night. He was a Sunnyasi--a houseless, wandering
mendicant, depending on his neighbours for his daily bread; and so
long as there is a morsel to divide in India, neither priest nor beggar
starves. He had never in his life tasted meat, and very seldom eaten
even fish. A five-pound note would have covered his personal expenses
for food through any one of the many years in which he had been absolute
master of millions of money. Even when he was being lionised in London
he had held before him his dream of peace and quiet--the long, white,
dusty Indian road, printed all over with bare feet, the incessant,
slow-moving traffic, and the sharp-smelling wood smoke curling up under
the fig-trees in the twilight, where the wayfarers sit at their evening
meal.

When the time came to make that dream true the Prime Minister took
the proper steps, and in three days you might more easily have found a
bubble in the trough of the long Atlantic seas, than Purun Dass among
the roving, gathering, separating millions of India.

At night his antelope skin was spread where the darkness overtook
him--sometimes in a Sunnyasi monastery by the roadside; sometimes by a
mud-pillar shrine of Kala Pir, where the Jogis, who are another misty
division of holy men, would receive him as they do those who know what
castes and divisions are worth; sometimes on the outskirts of a little
Hindu village, where the children would steal up with the food
their parents had prepared; and sometimes on the pitch of the bare
grazing-grounds, where the flame of his stick fire waked the drowsy
camels. It was all one to Purun Dass--or Purun Bhagat, as he called
himself now. Earth, people, and food were all one. But unconsciously
his feet drew him away northward and eastward; from the south to
Rohtak; from Rohtak to Kurnool; from Kurnool to ruined Samanah, and then
up-stream along the dried bed of the Gugger river that fills only when
the rain falls in the hills, till one day he saw the far line of the
great Himalayas.

Then Purun Bhagat smiled, for he remembered that his mother was of
Rajput Brahmin birth, from Kulu way--a Hill-woman, always home-sick for
the snows--and that the least touch of Hill blood draws a man in the end
back to where he belongs.

“Yonder,” said Purun Bhagat, breasting the lower slopes of the Sewaliks,
where the cacti stand up like seven-branched candlesticks-“yonder I
shall sit down and get knowledge”; and the cool wind of the Himalayas
whistled about his ears as he trod the road that led to Simla.

The last time he had come that way it had been in state, with a
clattering cavalry escort, to visit the gentlest and most affable of
Viceroys; and the two had talked for an hour together about mutual
friends in London, and what the Indian common folk really thought of
things. This time Purun Bhagat paid no calls, but leaned on the rail
of the Mall, watching that glorious view of the Plains spread out
forty miles below, till a native Mohammedan policeman told him he was
obstructing traffic; and Purun Bhagat salaamed reverently to the Law,
because he knew the value of it, and was seeking for a Law of his own.
Then he moved on, and slept that night in an empty hut at Chota Simla,
which looks like the very last end of the earth, but it was only the
beginning of his journey. He followed the Himalaya-Thibet road, the
little ten-foot track that is blasted out of solid rock, or strutted out
on timbers over gulfs a thousand feet deep; that dips into warm, wet,
shut-in valleys, and climbs out across bare, grassy hill-shoulders where
the sun strikes like a burning-glass; or turns through dripping, dark
forests where the tree-ferns dress the trunks from head to heel, and the
pheasant calls to his mate. And he met Thibetan herdsmen with their dogs
and flocks of sheep, each sheep with a little bag of borax on his back,
and wandering wood-cutters, and cloaked and blanketed Lamas from
Thibet, coming into India on pilgrimage, and envoys of little solitary
Hill-states, posting furiously on ring-streaked and piebald ponies, or
the cavalcade of a Rajah paying a visit; or else for a long, clear day
he would see nothing more than a black bear grunting and rooting below
in the valley. When he first started, the roar of the world he had left
still rang in his ears, as the roar of a tunnel rings long after the
train has passed through; but when he had put the Mutteeanee Pass behind
him that was all done, and Purun Bhagat was alone with himself, walking,
wondering, and thinking, his eyes on the ground, and his thoughts with
the clouds.

One evening he crossed the highest pass he had met till then--it had
been a two-day’s climb--and came out on a line of snow-peaks that banded
all the horizon--mountains from fifteen to twenty thousand feet high,
looking almost near enough to hit with a stone, though they were
fifty or sixty miles away. The pass was crowned with dense, dark
forest--deodar, walnut, wild cherry, wild olive, and wild pear, but
mostly deodar, which is the Himalayan cedar; and under the shadow of the
deodars stood a deserted shrine to Kali--who is Durga, who is Sitala,
who is sometimes worshipped against the smallpox.

Purun Dass swept the stone floor clean, smiled at the grinning statue,
made himself a little mud fireplace at the back of the shrine,
spread his antelope skin on a bed of fresh pine-needles, tucked his
bairagi--his brass-handled crutch--under his armpit, and sat down to
rest.

Immediately below him the hillside fell away, clean and cleared for
fifteen hundred feet, where a little village of stone-walled houses,
with roofs of beaten earth, clung to the steep tilt. All round it the
tiny terraced fields lay out like aprons of patchwork on the knees of
the mountain, and cows no bigger than beetles grazed between the smooth
stone circles of the threshing-floors. Looking across the valley, the
eye was deceived by the size of things, and could not at first realise
that what seemed to be low scrub, on the opposite mountain-flank, was
in truth a forest of hundred-foot pines. Purun Bhagat saw an eagle swoop
across the gigantic hollow, but the great bird dwindled to a dot ere it
was half-way over. A few bands of scattered clouds strung up and down
the valley, catching on a shoulder of the hills, or rising up and dying
out when they were level with the head of the pass. And “Here shall I
find peace,” said Purun Bhagat.

Now, a Hill-man makes nothing of a few hundred feet up or down, and as
soon as the villagers saw the smoke in the deserted shrine, the village
priest climbed up the terraced hillside to welcome the stranger.

When he met Purun Bhagat’s eyes--the eyes of a man used to control
thousands--he bowed to the earth, took the begging-bowl without a word,
and returned to the village, saying, “We have at last a holy man.
Never have I seen such a man. He is of the Plains--but pale-coloured--a
Brahmin of the Brahmins.” Then all the housewives of the village said,
“Think you he will stay with us?” and each did her best to cook the
most savoury meal for the Bhagat. Hill-food is very simple, but with
buckwheat and Indian corn, and rice and red pepper, and little fish out
of the stream in the valley, and honey from the flue-like hives built in
the stone walls, and dried apricots, and turmeric, and wild ginger, and
bannocks of flour, a devout woman can make good things, and it was a
full bowl that the priest carried to the Bhagat. Was he going to stay?
asked the priest. Would he need a chela--a disciple--to beg for him? Had
he a blanket against the cold weather? Was the food good?

Purun Bhagat ate, and thanked the giver. It was in his mind to stay.
That was sufficient, said the priest. Let the begging-bowl be placed
outside the shrine, in the hollow made by those two twisted roots, and
daily should the Bhagat be fed; for the village felt honoured that such
a man--he looked timidly into the Bhagat’s face--should tarry among
them.

That day saw the end of Purun Bhagat’s wanderings. He had come to the
place appointed for him--the silence and the space. After this, time
stopped, and he, sitting at the mouth of the shrine, could not tell
whether he were alive or dead; a man with control of his limbs, or a
part of the hills, and the clouds, and the shifting rain and sunlight.
He would repeat a Name softly to himself a hundred hundred times, till,
at each repetition, he seemed to move more and more out of his body,
sweeping up to the doors of some tremendous discovery; but, just as the
door was opening, his body would drag him back, and, with grief, he felt
he was locked up again in the flesh and bones of Purun Bhagat.

Every morning the filled begging-bowl was laid silently in the crutch of
the roots outside the shrine. Sometimes the priest brought it; sometimes
a Ladakhi trader, lodging in the village, and anxious to get merit,
trudged up the path; but, more often, it was the woman who had cooked
the meal overnight; and she would murmur, hardly above her breath.
“Speak for me before the gods, Bhagat. Speak for such a one, the wife
of so-and-so!” Now and then some bold child would be allowed the honour,
and Purun Bhagat would hear him drop the bowl and run as fast as his
little legs could carry him, but the Bhagat never came down to the
village. It was laid out like a map at his feet. He could see the
evening gatherings, held on the circle of the threshing-floors, because
that was the only level ground; could see the wonderful unnamed green
of the young rice, the indigo blues of the Indian corn, the dock-like
patches of buckwheat, and, in its season, the red bloom of the amaranth,
whose tiny seeds, being neither grain nor pulse, make a food that can be
lawfully eaten by Hindus in time of fasts.

When the year turned, the roofs of the huts were all little squares of
purest gold, for it was on the roofs that they laid out their cobs of
the corn to dry. Hiving and harvest, rice-sowing and husking, passed
before his eyes, all embroidered down there on the many-sided plots of
fields, and he thought of them all, and wondered what they all led to at
the long last.

Even in populated India a man cannot a day sit still before the wild
things run over him as though he were a rock; and in that wilderness
very soon the wild things, who knew Kali’s Shrine well, came back to
look at the intruder. The langurs, the big gray-whiskered monkeys of
the Himalayas, were, naturally, the first, for they are alive with
curiosity; and when they had upset the begging-bowl, and rolled it round
the floor, and tried their teeth on the brass-handled crutch, and made
faces at the antelope skin, they decided that the human being who sat so
still was harmless. At evening, they would leap down from the pines, and
beg with their hands for things to eat, and then swing off in graceful
curves. They liked the warmth of the fire, too, and huddled round it
till Purun Bhagat had to push them aside to throw on more fuel; and
in the morning, as often as not, he would find a furry ape sharing his
blanket. All day long, one or other of the tribe would sit by his side,
staring out at the snows, crooning and looking unspeakably wise and
sorrowful.

After the monkeys came the barasingh, that big deer which is like our
red deer, but stronger. He wished to rub off the velvet of his horns
against the cold stones of Kali’s statue, and stamped his feet when he
saw the man at the shrine. But Purun Bhagat never moved, and, little by
little, the royal stag edged up and nuzzled his shoulder. Purun Bhagat
slid one cool hand along the hot antlers, and the touch soothed the
fretted beast, who bowed his head, and Purun Bhagat very softly rubbed
and ravelled off the velvet. Afterward, the barasingh brought his doe
and fawn--gentle things that mumbled on the holy man’s blanket--or would
come alone at night, his eyes green in the fire-flicker, to take his
share of fresh walnuts. At last, the musk-deer, the shyest and almost
the smallest of the deerlets, came, too, her big rabbity ears erect;
even brindled, silent mushick-nabha must needs find out what the
light in the shrine meant, and drop out her moose-like nose into Purun
Bhagat’s lap, coming and going with the shadows of the fire. Purun
Bhagat called them all “my brothers,” and his low call of “Bhai! Bhai!”
 would draw them from the forest at noon if they were within ear shot.
The Himalayan black bear, moody and suspicious--Sona, who has the
V-shaped white mark under his chin--passed that way more than once; and
since the Bhagat showed no fear, Sona showed no anger, but watched him,
and came closer, and begged a share of the caresses, and a dole of bread
or wild berries. Often, in the still dawns, when the Bhagat would climb
to the very crest of the pass to watch the red day walking along the
peaks of the snows, he would find Sona shuffling and grunting at his
heels, thrusting, a curious fore-paw under fallen trunks, and bringing
it away with a WHOOF of impatience; or his early steps would wake Sona
where he lay curled up, and the great brute, rising erect, would think
to fight, till he heard the Bhagat’s voice and knew his best friend.

Nearly all hermits and holy men who live apart from the big cities have
the reputation of being able to work miracles with the wild things, but
all the miracle lies in keeping still, in never making a hasty movement,
and, for a long time, at least, in never looking directly at a visitor.
The villagers saw the outline of the barasingh stalking like a shadow
through the dark forest behind the shrine; saw the minaul, the Himalayan
pheasant, blazing in her best colours before Kali’s statue; and the
langurs on their haunches, inside, playing with the walnut shells. Some
of the children, too, had heard Sona singing to himself, bear-fashion,
behind the fallen rocks, and the Bhagat’s reputation as miracle-worker
stood firm.

Yet nothing was farther from his mind than miracles. He believed that
all things were one big Miracle, and when a man knows that much he knows
something to go upon. He knew for a certainty that there was nothing
great and nothing little in this world: and day and night he strove to
think out his way into the heart of things, back to the place whence his
soul had come.

So thinking, his untrimmed hair fell down about his shoulders, the stone
slab at the side of the antelope skin was dented into a little hole
by the foot of his brass-handled crutch, and the place between the
tree-trunks, where the begging-bowl rested day after day, sunk and wore
into a hollow almost as smooth as the brown shell itself; and each beast
knew his exact place at the fire. The fields changed their colours with
the seasons; the threshing-floors filled and emptied, and filled again
and again; and again and again, when winter came, the langurs frisked
among the branches feathered with light snow, till the mother-monkeys
brought their sad-eyed little babies up from the warmer valleys with the
spring. There were few changes in the village. The priest was older, and
many of the little children who used to come with the begging-dish sent
their own children now; and when you asked of the villagers how long
their holy man had lived in Kali’s Shrine at the head of the pass, they
answered, “Always.”

Then came such summer rains as had not been known in the Hills for many
seasons. Through three good months the valley was wrapped in cloud
and soaking mist--steady, unrelenting downfall, breaking off into
thunder-shower after thunder-shower. Kali’s Shrine stood above the
clouds, for the most part, and there was a whole month in which the
Bhagat never caught a glimpse of his village. It was packed away under
a white floor of cloud that swayed and shifted and rolled on itself and
bulged upward, but never broke from its piers--the streaming flanks of
the valley.

All that time he heard nothing but the sound of a million little waters,
overhead from the trees, and underfoot along the ground, soaking through
the pine-needles, dripping from the tongues of draggled fern, and
spouting in newly-torn muddy channels down the slopes. Then the sun
came out, and drew forth the good incense of the deodars and the
rhododendrons, and that far-off, clean smell which the Hill people call
“the smell of the snows.” The hot sunshine lasted for a week, and then
the rains gathered together for their last downpour, and the water fell
in sheets that flayed off the skin of the ground and leaped back in
mud. Purun Bhagat heaped his fire high that night, for he was sure his
brothers would need warmth; but never a beast came to the shrine, though
he called and called till he dropped asleep, wondering what had happened
in the woods.

It was in the black heart of the night, the rain drumming like a
thousand drums, that he was roused by a plucking at his blanket, and,
stretching out, felt the little hand of a langur. “It is better here
than in the trees,” he said sleepily, loosening a fold of blanket; “take
it and be warm.” The monkey caught his hand and pulled hard. “Is it
food, then?” said Purun Bhagat. “Wait awhile, and I will prepare some.”
 As he kneeled to throw fuel on the fire the langur ran to the door of
the shrine, crooned and ran back again, plucking at the man’s knee.

“What is it? What is thy trouble, Brother?” said Purun Bhagat, for the
langur’s eyes were full of things that he could not tell. “Unless one of
thy caste be in a trap--and none set traps here--I will not go into that
weather. Look, Brother, even the barasingh comes for shelter!”

The deer’s antlers clashed as he strode into the shrine, clashed against
the grinning statue of Kali. He lowered them in Purun Bhagat’s direction
and stamped uneasily, hissing through his half-shut nostrils.

“Hai! Hai! Hai!” said the Bhagat, snapping his fingers, “Is THIS payment
for a night’s lodging?” But the deer pushed him toward the door, and as
he did so Purun Bhagat heard the sound of something opening with a sigh,
and saw two slabs of the floor draw away from each other, while the
sticky earth below smacked its lips.

“Now I see,” said Purun Bhagat. “No blame to my brothers that they did
not sit by the fire to-night. The mountain is falling. And yet--why
should I go?” His eye fell on the empty begging-bowl, and his face
changed. “They have given me good food daily since--since I came, and,
if I am not swift, to-morrow there will not be one mouth in the valley.
Indeed, I must go and warn them below. Back there, Brother! Let me get
to the fire.”

The barasingh backed unwillingly as Purun Bhagat drove a pine torch deep
into the flame, twirling it till it was well lit. “Ah! ye came to warn
me,” he said, rising. “Better than that we shall do; better than that.
Out, now, and lend me thy neck, Brother, for I have but two feet.”

He clutched the bristling withers of the barasingh with his right hand,
held the torch away with his left, and stepped out of the shrine into
the desperate night. There was no breath of wind, but the rain nearly
drowned the flare as the great deer hurried down the slope, sliding
on his haunches. As soon as they were clear of the forest more of the
Bhagat’s brothers joined them. He heard, though he could not see, the
langurs pressing about him, and behind them the uhh! uhh! of Sona. The
rain matted his long white hair into ropes; the water splashed beneath
his bare feet, and his yellow robe clung to his frail old body, but he
stepped down steadily, leaning against the barasingh. He was no longer
a holy man, but Sir Purun Dass, K.C.I.E., Prime Minister of no small
State, a man accustomed to command, going out to save life. Down
the steep, plashy path they poured all together, the Bhagat and his
brothers, down and down till the deer’s feet clicked and stumbled on the
wall of a threshing-floor, and he snorted because he smelt Man. Now they
were at the head of the one crooked village street, and the Bhagat beat
with his crutch on the barred windows of the blacksmith’s house, as his
torch blazed up in the shelter of the eaves. “Up and out!” cried Purun
Bhagat; and he did not know his own voice, for it was years since he had
spoken aloud to a man. “The hill falls! The hill is falling! Up and out,
oh, you within!”

“It is our Bhagat,” said the blacksmith’s wife. “He stands among his
beasts. Gather the little ones and give the call.”

It ran from house to house, while the beasts, cramped in the narrow way,
surged and huddled round the Bhagat, and Sona puffed impatiently.

The people hurried into the street--they were no more than seventy souls
all told--and in the glare of the torches they saw their Bhagat holding
back the terrified barasingh, while the monkeys plucked piteously at his
skirts, and Sona sat on his haunches and roared.

“Across the valley and up the next hill!” shouted Purun Bhagat. “Leave
none behind! We follow!”

Then the people ran as only Hill folk can run, for they knew that in a
landslip you must climb for the highest ground across the valley. They
fled, splashing through the little river at the bottom, and panted up
the terraced fields on the far side, while the Bhagat and his brethren
followed. Up and up the opposite mountain they climbed, calling to each
other by name--the roll-call of the village--and at their heels toiled
the big barasingh, weighted by the failing strength of Purun Bhagat.
At last the deer stopped in the shadow of a deep pinewood, five hundred
feet up the hillside. His instinct, that had warned him of the coming
slide, told him he would he safe here.

Purun Bhagat dropped fainting by his side, for the chill of the rain and
that fierce climb were killing him; but first he called to the scattered
torches ahead, “Stay and count your numbers”; then, whispering to the
deer as he saw the lights gather in a cluster: “Stay with me, Brother.
Stay--till--I--go!”

There was a sigh in the air that grew to a mutter, and a mutter that
grew to a roar, and a roar that passed all sense of hearing, and the
hillside on which the villagers stood was hit in the darkness, and
rocked to the blow. Then a note as steady, deep, and true as the deep C
of the organ drowned everything for perhaps five minutes, while the very
roots of the pines quivered to it. It died away, and the sound of the
rain falling on miles of hard ground and grass changed to the muffled
drum of water on soft earth. That told its own tale.

Never a villager--not even the priest--was bold enough to speak to the
Bhagat who had saved their lives. They crouched under the pines and
waited till the day. When it came they looked across the valley and
saw that what had been forest, and terraced field, and track-threaded
grazing-ground was one raw, red, fan-shaped smear, with a few trees
flung head-down on the scarp. That red ran high up the hill of their
refuge, damming back the little river, which had begun to spread into a
brick-coloured lake. Of the village, of the road to the shrine, of the
shrine itself, and the forest behind, there was no trace. For one mile
in width and two thousand feet in sheer depth the mountain-side had come
away bodily, planed clean from head to heel.

And the villagers, one by one, crept through the wood to pray before
their Bhagat. They saw the barasingh standing over him, who fled when
they came near, and they heard the langurs wailing in the branches,
and Sona moaning up the hill; but their Bhagat was dead, sitting
cross-legged, his back against a tree, his crutch under his armpit, and
his face turned to the north-east.

The priest said: “Behold a miracle after a miracle, for in this very
attitude must all Sunnyasis be buried! Therefore where he now is we will
build the temple to our holy man.”

They built the temple before a year was ended--a little stone-and-earth
shrine--and they called the hill the Bhagat’s hill, and they worship
there with lights and flowers and offerings to this day. But they do
not know that the saint of their worship is the late Sir Purun Dass,
K.C.I.E., D.C.L., Ph.D., etc., once Prime Minister of the progressive
and enlightened State of Mohiniwala, and honorary or corresponding
member of more learned and scientific societies than will ever do any
good in this world or the next.




A SONG OF KABIR

     Oh, light was the world that he weighed in his hands!
     Oh, heavy the tale of his fiefs and his lands!
     He has gone from the guddee and put on the shroud,
     And departed in guise of bairagi avowed!

     Now the white road to Delhi is mat for his feet,
     The sal and the kikar must guard him from heat;
     His home is the camp, and the waste, and the crowd--
     He is seeking the Way as bairagi avowed!

     He has looked upon Man, and his eyeballs are clear
     (There was One; there is One, and but One, saith Kabir);
     The Red Mist of Doing has thinned to a cloud--
     He has taken the Path for bairagi avowed!

     To learn and discern of his brother the clod,
     Of his brother the brute, and his brother the God.
     He has gone from the council and put on the shroud
     (“Can ye hear?” saith Kabir), a bairagi avowed!




LETTING IN THE JUNGLE

      Veil them, cover them, wall them round--
        Blossom, and creeper, and weed--
      Let us forget the sight and the sound,
        The smell and the touch of the breed!

      Fat black ash by the altar-stone,
        Here is the white-foot rain,
      And the does bring forth in the fields unsown,
        And none shall affright them again;
      And the blind walls crumble, unknown, o’erthrown
        And none shall inhabit again!


You will remember that after Mowgli had pinned Shere Khan’s hide to
the Council Rock, he told as many as were left of the Seeonee Pack that
henceforward he would hunt in the Jungle alone; and the four children of
Mother and Father Wolf said that they would hunt with him. But it is not
easy to change one’s life all in a minute--particularly in the Jungle.
The first thing Mowgli did, when the disorderly Pack had slunk off, was
to go to the home-cave, and sleep for a day and a night. Then he told
Mother Wolf and Father Wolf as much as they could understand of his
adventures among men; and when he made the morning sun flicker up and
down the blade of his skinning-knife,--the same he had skinned Shere
Khan with,--they said he had learned something. Then Akela and Gray
Brother had to explain their share of the great buffalo-drive in the
ravine, and Baloo toiled up the hill to hear all about it, and Bagheera
scratched himself all over with pure delight at the way in which Mowgli
had managed his war.

It was long after sunrise, but no one dreamed of going to sleep, and
from time to time, during the talk, Mother Wolf would throw up her head,
and sniff a deep snuff of satisfaction as the wind brought her the smell
of the tiger-skin on the Council Rock.

“But for Akela and Gray Brother here,” Mowgli said, at the end, “I could
have done nothing. Oh, mother, mother! if thou hadst seen the black
herd-bulls pour down the ravine, or hurry through the gates when the
Man-Pack flung stones at me!”

“I am glad I did not see that last,” said Mother Wolf stiffly. “It is
not MY custom to suffer my cubs to be driven to and fro like jackals.
_I_ would have taken a price from the Man-Pack; but I would have spared
the woman who gave thee the milk. Yes, I would have spared her alone.”

“Peace, peace, Raksha!” said Father Wolf, lazily. “Our Frog has come
back again--so wise that his own father must lick his feet; and what is
a cut, more or less, on the head? Leave Men alone.” Baloo and Bagheera
both echoed: “Leave Men alone.”

Mowgli, his head on Mother Wolf’s side, smiled contentedly, and said
that, for his own part, he never wished to see, or hear, or smell Man
again.

“But what,” said Akela, cocking one ear--“but what if men do not leave
thee alone, Little Brother?”

“We be FIVE,” said Gray Brother, looking round at the company, and
snapping his jaws on the last word.

“We also might attend to that hunting,” said Bagheera, with a little
switch-switch of his tail, looking at Baloo. “But why think of men now,
Akela?”

“For this reason,” the Lone Wolf answered: “when that yellow chief’s
hide was hung up on the rock, I went back along our trail to the
village, stepping in my tracks, turning aside, and lying down, to make
a mixed trail in case one should follow us. But when I had fouled the
trail so that I myself hardly knew it again, Mang, the Bat, came hawking
between the trees, and hung up above me.” Said Mang, “The village of the
Man-Pack, where they cast out the Man-cub, hums like a hornet’s nest.”

“It was a big stone that I threw,” chuckled Mowgli, who had often amused
himself by throwing ripe paw-paws into a hornet’s nest, and racing off
to the nearest pool before the hornets caught him.

“I asked of Mang what he had seen. He said that the Red Flower blossomed
at the gate of the village, and men sat about it carrying guns. Now _I_
know, for I have good cause,”--Akela looked down at the old dry scars
on his flank and side,--“that men do not carry guns for pleasure.
Presently, Little Brother, a man with a gun follows our trail--if,
indeed, he be not already on it.”

“But why should he? Men have cast me out. What more do they need?” said
Mowgli angrily.

“Thou art a man, Little Brother,” Akela returned. “It is not for US, the
Free Hunters, to tell thee what thy brethren do, or why.”

He had just time to snatch up his paw as the skinning-knife cut deep
into the ground below. Mowgli struck quicker than an average human
eye could follow but Akela was a wolf; and even a dog, who is very far
removed from the wild wolf, his ancestor, can be waked out of deep sleep
by a cart-wheel touching his flank, and can spring away unharmed before
that wheel comes on.

“Another time,” Mowgli said quietly, returning the knife to its sheath,
“speak of the Man-Pack and of Mowgli in TWO breaths--not one.”

“Phff! That is a sharp tooth,” said Akela, snuffing at the blade’s
cut in the earth, “but living with the Man-Pack has spoiled thine eye,
Little Brother. I could have killed a buck while thou wast striking.”

Bagheera sprang to his feet, thrust up his head as far as he could,
sniffed, and stiffened through every curve in his body. Gray Brother
followed his example quickly, keeping a little to his left to get the
wind that was blowing from the right, while Akela bounded fifty yards up
wind, and, half-crouching, stiffened too. Mowgli looked on enviously.
He could smell things as very few human beings could, but he had never
reached the hair-trigger-like sensitiveness of a Jungle nose; and his
three months in the smoky village had set him back sadly. However, he
dampened his finger, rubbed it on his nose, and stood erect to catch the
upper scent, which, though it is the faintest, is the truest.

“Man!” Akela growled, dropping on his haunches.

“Buldeo!” said Mowgli, sitting down. “He follows our trail, and yonder
is the sunlight on his gun. Look!”

It was no more than a splash of sunlight, for a fraction of a second,
on the brass clamps of the old Tower musket, but nothing in the Jungle
winks with just that flash, except when the clouds race over the sky.
Then a piece of mica, or a little pool, or even a highly-polished leaf
will flash like a heliograph. But that day was cloudless and still.

“I knew men would follow,” said Akela triumphantly. “Not for nothing
have I led the Pack.”

The four cubs said nothing, but ran down hill on their bellies, melting
into the thorn and under-brush as a mole melts into a lawn.

“Where go ye, and without word?” Mowgli called.

“H’sh! We roll his skull here before mid-day!” Gray Brother answered.

“Back! Back and wait! Man does not eat Man!” Mowgli shrieked.

“Who was a wolf but now? Who drove the knife at me for thinking he might
be Man?” said Akela, as the four wolves turned back sullenly and dropped
to heel.

“Am I to give reason for all I choose to, do?” said Mowgli furiously.

“That is Man! There speaks Man!” Bagheera muttered under his whiskers.
“Even so did men talk round the King’s cages at Oodeypore. We of the
Jungle know that Man is wisest of all. If we trusted our ears we should
know that of all things he is most foolish.” Raising his voice, he
added, “The Man-cub is right in this. Men hunt in packs. To kill one,
unless we know what the others will do, is bad hunting. Come, let us see
what this Man means toward us.”

“We will not come,” Gray Brother growled. “Hunt alone, Little Brother.
WE know our own minds. The skull would have been ready to bring by now.”

Mowgli had been looking from one to the other of his friends, his chest
heaving and his eyes full of tears. He strode forward to the wolves,
and, dropping on one knee, said: “Do I not know my mind? Look at me!”

They looked uneasily, and when their eyes wandered, he called them back
again and again, till their hair stood up all over their bodies, and
they trembled in every limb, while Mowgli stared and stared.

“Now,” said he, “of us five, which is leader?”

“Thou art leader, Little Brother,” said Gray Brother, and he licked
Mowgli’s foot.

“Follow, then,” said Mowgli, and the four followed at his heels with
their tails between their legs.

“This comes of living with the Man-Pack,” said Bagheera, slipping down
after them. “There is more in the Jungle now than Jungle Law, Baloo.”

The old bear said nothing, but he thought many things.

Mowgli cut across noiselessly through the Jungle, at right angles to
Buldeo’s path, till, parting the undergrowth, he saw the old man, his
musket on his shoulder, running up the trail of overnight at a dog-trot.

You will remember that Mowgli had left the village with the heavy weight
of Shere Khan’s raw hide on his shoulders, while Akela and Gray Brother
trotted behind, so that the triple trail was very clearly marked.
Presently Buldeo came to where Akela, as you know, had gone back and
mixed it all up. Then he sat down, and coughed and grunted, and made
little casts round and about into the Jungle to pick it up again, and,
all the time he could have thrown a stone over those who were watching
him. No one can be so silent as a wolf when he does not care to be
heard; and Mowgli, though the wolves thought he moved very clumsily,
could come and go like a shadow. They ringed the old man as a school
of porpoises ring a steamer at full speed, and as they ringed him they
talked unconcernedly, for their speech began below the lowest end of the
scale that untrained human beings can hear. [The other end is bounded by
the high squeak of Mang, the Bat, which very many people cannot catch at
all. From that note all the bird and bat and insect talk takes on.]

“This is better than any kill,” said Gray Brother, as Buldeo stooped
and peered and puffed. “He looks like a lost pig in the Jungles by the
river. What does he say?” Buldeo was muttering savagely.

Mowgli translated. “He says that packs of wolves must have danced round
me. He says that he never saw such a trail in his life. He says he is
tired.”

“He will be rested before he picks it up again,” said Bagheera coolly,
as he slipped round a tree-trunk, in the game of blindman’s-buff that
they were playing. “NOW, what does the lean thing do?”

“Eat or blow smoke out of his mouth. Men always play with their mouths,”
 said Mowgli; and the silent trailers saw the old man fill and light
and puff at a water-pipe, and they took good note of the smell of the
tobacco, so as to be sure of Buldeo in the darkest night, if necessary.

Then a little knot of charcoal-burners came down the path, and naturally
halted to speak to Buldeo, whose fame as a hunter reached for at least
twenty miles round. They all sat down and smoked, and Bagheera and
the others came up and watched while Buldeo began to tell the story of
Mowgli, the Devil-child, from one end to another, with additions and
inventions. How he himself had really killed Shere Khan; and how Mowgli
had turned himself into a wolf, and fought with him all the afternoon,
and changed into a boy again and bewitched Buldeo’s rifle, so that the
bullet turned the corner, when he pointed it at Mowgli, and killed one
of Buldeo’s own buffaloes; and how the village, knowing him to be the
bravest hunter in Seeonee, had sent him out to kill this Devil-child.
But meantime the village had got hold of Messua and her husband, who
were undoubtedly the father and mother of this Devil-child, and had
barricaded them in their own hut, and presently would torture them to
make them confess they were witch and wizard, and then they would be
burned to death.

“When?” said the charcoal-burners, because they would very much like to
be present at the ceremony.

Buldeo said that nothing would be done till he returned, because the
village wished him to kill the Jungle Boy first. After that they would
dispose of Messua and her husband, and divide their lands and buffaloes
among the village. Messua’s husband had some remarkably fine buffaloes,
too. It was an excellent thing to destroy wizards, Buldeo thought; and
people who entertained Wolf-children out of the Jungle were clearly the
worst kind of witches.

But, said the charcoal-burners, what would happen if the English heard
of it? The English, they had heard, were a perfectly mad people, who
would not let honest farmers kill witches in peace.

Why, said Buldeo, the head-man of the village would report that Messua
and her husband had died of snake-bite. THAT was all arranged, and the
only thing now was to kill the Wolf-child. They did not happen to have
seen anything of such a creature?

The charcoal-burners looked round cautiously, and thanked their stars
they had not; but they had no doubt that so brave a man as Buldeo would
find him if any one could. The sun was getting rather low, and they had
an idea that they would push on to Buldeo’s village and see that wicked
witch. Buldeo said that, though it was his duty to kill the Devil-child,
he could not think of letting a party of unarmed men go through the
Jungle, which might produce the Wolf-demon at any minute, without his
escort. He, therefore, would accompany them, and if the sorcerer’s child
appeared--well, he would show them how the best hunter in Seeonee dealt
with such things. The Brahmin, he said, had given him a charm against
the creature that made everything perfectly safe.

“What says he? What says he? What says he?” the wolves repeated every
few minutes; and Mowgli translated until he came to the witch part of
the story, which was a little beyond him, and then he said that the man
and woman who had been so kind to him were trapped.

“Does Man trap Man?” said Bagheera.

“So he says. I cannot understand the talk. They are all mad together.
What have Messua and her man to do with me that they should be put in
a trap; and what is all this talk about the Red Flower? I must look
to this. Whatever they would do to Messua they will not do till Buldeo
returns. And so----” Mowgli thought hard, with his fingers playing round
the haft of the skinning-knife, while Buldeo and the charcoal-burners
went off very valiantly in single file.

“I go hot-foot back to the Man-Pack,” Mowgli said at last.

“And those?” said Gray Brother, looking hungrily after the brown backs
of the charcoal-burners.

“Sing them home,” said Mowgli, with a grin; “I do not wish them to be at
the village gates till it is dark. Can ye hold them?”

Gray Brother bared his white teeth in contempt. “We can head them round
and round in circles like tethered goats--if I know Man.”

“That I do not need. Sing to them a little, lest they be lonely on the
road, and, Gray Brother, the song need not be of the sweetest. Go with
them, Bagheera, and help make that song. When night is shut down, meet
me by the village--Gray Brother knows the place.”

“It is no light hunting to work for a Man-cub. When shall I sleep?” said
Bagheera, yawning, though his eyes showed that he was delighted with the
amusement. “Me to sing to naked men! But let us try.”

He lowered his head so that the sound would travel, and cried a long,
long, “Good hunting”--a midnight call in the afternoon, which was quite
awful enough to begin with. Mowgli heard it rumble, and rise, and fall,
and die off in a creepy sort of whine behind him, and laughed to himself
as he ran through the Jungle. He could see the charcoal-burners huddled
in a knot; old Buldeo’s gun-barrel waving, like a banana-leaf, to every
point of the compass at once. Then Gray Brother gave the Ya-la-hi!
Yalaha! call for the buck-driving, when the Pack drives the nilghai, the
big blue cow, before them, and it seemed to come from the very ends of
the earth, nearer, and nearer, and nearer, till it ended in a shriek
snapped off short. The other three answered, till even Mowgli could have
vowed that the full Pack was in full cry, and then they all broke
into the magnificent Morning-song in the Jungle, with every turn, and
flourish, and grace-note that a deep-mouthed wolf of the Pack knows.
This is a rough rendering of the song, but you must imagine what it
sounds like when it breaks the afternoon hush of the Jungle:--

     One moment past our bodies cast
       No shadow on the plain;
     Now clear and black they stride our track,
       And we run home again.
     In morning hush, each rock and bush
       Stands hard, and high, and raw:
     Then give the Call: “Good rest to all
       That keep The Jungle Law!”

     Now horn and pelt our peoples melt
       In covert to abide;
     Now, crouched and still, to cave and hill
       Our Jungle Barons glide.
     Now, stark and plain, Man’s oxen strain,
       That draw the new-yoked plough;
     Now, stripped and dread, the dawn is red
       Above the lit talao.

     Ho! Get to lair! The sun’s aflare
       Behind the breathing grass:
     And cracking through the young bamboo
       The warning whispers pass.
     By day made strange, the woods we range
       With blinking eyes we scan;
     While down the skies the wild duck cries
       “The Day--the Day to Man!”

     The dew is dried that drenched our hide
       Or washed about our way;
     And where we drank, the puddled bank
       Is crisping into clay.
     The traitor Dark gives up each mark
       Of stretched or hooded claw;
     Then hear the Call: “Good rest to all
       That keep the Jungle Law!”

But no translation can give the effect of it, or the yelping scorn the
Four threw into every word of it, as they heard the trees crash when
the men hastily climbed up into the branches, and Buldeo began repeating
incantations and charms. Then they lay down and slept, for, like all who
live by their own exertions, they were of a methodical cast of mind; and
no one can work well without sleep.

Meantime, Mowgli was putting the miles behind him, nine to the hour,
swinging on, delighted to find himself so fit after all his cramped
months among men. The one idea in his head was to get Messua and her
husband out of the trap, whatever it was; for he had a natural mistrust
of traps. Later on, he promised himself, he would pay his debts to the
village at large.

It was at twilight when he saw the well-remembered grazing-grounds, and
the dhak-tree where Gray Brother had waited for him on the morning that
he killed Shere Khan. Angry as he was at the whole breed and community
of Man, something jumped up in his throat and made him catch his breath
when he looked at the village roofs. He noticed that every one had come
in from the fields unusually early, and that, instead of getting to
their evening cooking, they gathered in a crowd under the village tree,
and chattered, and shouted.

“Men must always be making traps for men, or they are not content,” said
Mowgli. “Last night it was Mowgli--but that night seems many Rains ago.
To-night it is Messua and her man. To-morrow, and for very many nights
after, it will be Mowgli’s turn again.”

He crept along outside the wall till he came to Messua’s hut, and looked
through the window into the room. There lay Messua, gagged, and bound
hand and foot, breathing hard, and groaning: her husband was tied to the
gaily-painted bedstead. The door of the hut that opened into the street
was shut fast, and three or four people were sitting with their backs to
it.

Mowgli knew the manners and customs of the villagers very fairly. He
argued that so long as they could eat, and talk, and smoke, they would
not do anything else; but as soon as they had fed they would begin to be
dangerous. Buldeo would be coming in before long, and if his escort had
done its duty, Buldeo would have a very interesting tale to tell. So he
went in through the window, and, stooping over the man and the woman,
cut their thongs, pulling out the gags, and looked round the hut for
some milk.

Messua was half wild with pain and fear (she had been beaten and stoned
all the morning), and Mowgli put his hand over her mouth just in time
to stop a scream. Her husband was only bewildered and angry, and sat
picking dust and things out of his torn beard.

“I knew--I knew he would come,” Messua sobbed at last. “Now do I KNOW
that he is my son!” and she hugged Mowgli to her heart. Up to that time
Mowgli had been perfectly steady, but now he began to tremble all over,
and that surprised him immensely.

“Why are these thongs? Why have they tied thee?” he asked, after a
pause.

“To be put to the death for making a son of thee--what else?” said the
man sullenly. “Look! I bleed.”

Messua said nothing, but it was at her wounds that Mowgli looked, and
they heard him grit his teeth when he saw the blood.

“Whose work is this?” said he. “There is a price to pay.”

“The work of all the village. I was too rich. I had too many cattle.
THEREFORE she and I are witches, because we gave thee shelter.”

“I do not understand. Let Messua tell the tale.”

“I gave thee milk, Nathoo; dost thou remember?” Messua said timidly.
“Because thou wast my son, whom the tiger took, and because I loved thee
very dearly. They said that I was thy mother, the mother of a devil, and
therefore worthy of death.”

“And what is a devil?” said Mowgli. “Death I have seen.”

The man looked up gloomily, but Messua laughed. “See!” she said to her
husband, “I knew--I said that he was no sorcerer. He is my son--my son!”

“Son or sorcerer, what good will that do us?” the man answered. “We be
as dead already.”

“Yonder is the road to the Jungle”--Mowgli pointed through the window.
“Your hands and feet are free. Go now.”

“We do not know the Jungle, my son, as--as thou knowest,” Messua began.
“I do not think that I could walk far.”

“And the men and women would be upon our backs and drag us here again,”
 said the husband.

“H’m!” said Mowgli, and he tickled the palm of his hand with the tip
of his skinning-knife; “I have no wish to do harm to any one of this
village--YET. But I do not think they will stay thee. In a little while
they will have much else to think upon. Ah!” he lifted his head and
listened to shouting and trampling outside. “So they have let Buldeo
come home at last?”

“He was sent out this morning to kill thee,” Messua cried. “Didst thou
meet him?”

“Yes--we--I met him. He has a tale to tell and while he is telling it
there is time to do much. But first I will learn what they mean. Think
where ye would go, and tell me when I come back.”

He bounded through the window and ran along again outside the wall
of the village till he came within ear-shot of the crowd round the
peepul-tree. Buldeo was lying on the ground, coughing and groaning,
and every one was asking him questions. His hair had fallen about his
shoulders; his hands and legs were skinned from climbing up trees,
and he could hardly speak, but he felt the importance of his position
keenly. From time to time he said something about devils and singing
devils, and magic enchantment, just to give the crowd a taste of what
was coming. Then he called for water.

“Bah!” said Mowgli. “Chatter--chatter! Talk, talk! Men are
blood-brothers of the Bandar-log. Now he must wash his mouth with water;
now he must blow smoke; and when all that is done he has still his story
to tell. They are very wise people--men. They will leave no one to guard
Messua till their ears are stuffed with Buldeo’s tales. And--I grow as
lazy as they!”

He shook himself and glided back to the hut. Just as he was at the
window he felt a touch on his foot.

“Mother,” said he, for he knew that tongue well, “what dost THOU here?”

“I heard my children singing through the woods, and I followed the one I
loved best. Little Frog, I have a desire to see that woman who gave thee
milk,” said Mother Wolf, all wet with the dew.

“They have bound and mean to kill her. I have cut those ties, and she
goes with her man through the Jungle.”

“I also will follow. I am old, but not yet toothless.” Mother Wolf
reared herself up on end, and looked through the window into the dark of
the hut.

In a minute she dropped noiselessly, and all she said was: “I gave thee
thy first milk; but Bagheera speaks truth: Man goes to Man at the last.”

“Maybe,” said Mowgli, with a very unpleasant look on his face; “but
to-night I am very far from that trail. Wait here, but do not let her
see.”

“THOU wast never afraid of ME, Little Frog,” said Mother Wolf, backing
into the high grass, and blotting herself out, as she knew how.

“And now,” said Mowgli cheerfully, as he swung into the hut again, “they
are all sitting round Buldeo, who is saying that which did not happen.
When his talk is finished, they say they will assuredly come here with
the Red--with fire and burn you both. And then?”

“I have spoken to my man,” said Messua. “Khanhiwara is thirty miles from
here, but at Khanhiwara we may find the English--”

“And what Pack are they?” said Mowgli.

“I do not know. They be white, and it is said that they govern all
the land, and do not suffer people to burn or beat each other without
witnesses. If we can get thither to-night, we live. Otherwise we die.”

“Live, then. No man passes the gates to-night. But what does HE do?”
 Messua’s husband was on his hands and knees digging up the earth in one
corner of the hut.

“It is his little money,” said Messua. “We can take nothing else.”

“Ah, yes. The stuff that passes from hand to hand and never grows
warmer. Do they need it outside this place also?” said Mowgli.

The man stared angrily. “He is a fool, and no devil,” he muttered. “With
the money I can buy a horse. We are too bruised to walk far, and the
village will follow us in an hour.”

“I say they will NOT follow till I choose; but a horse is well thought
of, for Messua is tired.” Her husband stood up and knotted the last
of the rupees into his waist-cloth. Mowgli helped Messua through the
window, and the cool night air revived her, but the Jungle in the
starlight looked very dark and terrible.

“Ye know the trail to Khanhiwara?” Mowgli whispered.

They nodded.

“Good. Remember, now, not to be afraid. And there is no need to go
quickly. Only--only there may be some small singing in the Jungle behind
you and before.”

“Think you we would have risked a night in the Jungle through anything
less than the fear of burning? It is better to be killed by beasts than
by men,” said Messua’s husband; but Messua looked at Mowgli and smiled.

“I say,” Mowgli went on, just as though he were Baloo repeating an old
Jungle Law for the hundredth time to a foolish cub--“I say that not a
tooth in the Jungle is bared against you; not a foot in the Jungle is
lifted against you. Neither man nor beast shall stay you till you come
within eye-shot of Khanhiwara. There will be a watch about you.” He
turned quickly to Messua, saying, “HE does not believe, but thou wilt
believe?”

“Ay, surely, my son. Man, ghost, or wolf of the Jungle, I believe.”

“HE will be afraid when he hears my people singing. Thou wilt know and
understand. Go now, and slowly, for there is no need of any haste. The
gates are shut.”

Messua flung herself sobbing at Mowgli’s feet, but he lifted her very
quickly with a shiver. Then she hung about his neck and called him every
name of blessing she could think of, but her husband looked enviously
across his fields, and said: “IF we reach Khanhiwara, and I get the ear
of the English, I will bring such a lawsuit against the Brahmin and old
Buldeo and the others as shall eat the village to the bone. They shall
pay me twice over for my crops untilled and my buffaloes unfed. I will
have a great justice.”

Mowgli laughed. “I do not know what justice is, but--come next Rains.
and see what is left.”

They went off toward the Jungle, and Mother Wolf leaped from her place
of hiding.

“Follow!” said Mowgli; “and look to it that all the Jungle knows these
two are safe. Give tongue a little. I would call Bagheera.”

The long, low howl rose and fell, and Mowgli saw Messua’s husband flinch
and turn, half minded to run back to the hut.

“Go on,” Mowgli called cheerfully. “I said there might be singing. That
call will follow up to Khanhiwara. It is Favour of the Jungle.”

Messua urged her husband forward, and the darkness shut down on them and
Mother Wolf as Bagheera rose up almost under Mowgli’s feet, trembling
with delight of the night that drives the Jungle People wild.

“I am ashamed of thy brethren,” he said, purring. “What? Did they not
sing sweetly to Buldeo?” said Mowgli.

“Too well! Too well! They made even ME forget my pride, and, by the
Broken Lock that freed me, I went singing through the Jungle as though I
were out wooing in the spring! Didst thou not hear us?”

“I had other game afoot. Ask Buldeo if he liked the song. But where
are the Four? I do not wish one of the Man-Pack to leave the gates
to-night.”

“What need of the Four, then?” said Bagheera, shifting from foot to
foot, his eyes ablaze, and purring louder than ever. “I can hold them,
Little Brother. Is it killing at last? The singing and the sight of the
men climbing up the trees have made me very ready. Who is Man that we
should care for him--the naked brown digger, the hairless and toothless,
the eater of earth? I have followed him all day--at noon--in the white
sunlight. I herded him as the wolves herd buck. I am Bagheera! Bagheera!
Bagheera! As I dance with my shadow, so danced I with those men. Look!”
 The great panther leaped as a kitten leaps at a dead leaf whirling
overhead, struck left and right into the empty air, that sang under the
strokes, landed noiselessly, and leaped again and again, while the
half purr, half growl gathered head as steam rumbles in a boiler. “I
am Bagheera--in the jungle--in the night, and my strength is in me. Who
shall stay my stroke? Man-cub, with one blow of my paw I could beat thy
head flat as a dead frog in the summer!”

“Strike, then!” said Mowgli, in the dialect of the village, NOT the
talk of the Jungle, and the human words brought Bagheera to a full stop,
flung back on haunches that quivered under him, his head just at the
level of Mowgli’s. Once more Mowgli stared, as he had stared at the
rebellious cubs, full into the beryl-green eyes till the red glare
behind their green went out like the light of a lighthouse shut off
twenty miles across the sea; till the eyes dropped, and the big head
with them--dropped lower and lower, and the red rasp of a tongue grated
on Mowgli’s instep.

“Brother--Brother--Brother!” the boy whispered, stroking steadily and
lightly from the neck along the heaving back. “Be still, be still! It is
the fault of the night, and no fault of thine.”

“It was the smells of the night,” said Bagheera penitently. “This air
cries aloud to me. But how dost THOU know?”

Of course the air round an Indian village is full of all kinds of
smells, and to any creature who does nearly all his thinking through his
nose, smells are as maddening as music and drugs are to human beings.
Mowgli gentled the panther for a few minutes longer, and he lay down
like a cat before a fire, his paws tucked under his breast, and his eyes
half shut.

“Thou art of the Jungle and NOT of the Jungle,” he said at last. “And I
am only a black panther. But I love thee, Little Brother.”

“They are very long at their talk under the tree,” Mowgli said, without
noticing the last sentence. “Buldeo must have told many tales. They
should come soon to drag the woman and her man out of the trap and put
them into the Red Flower. They will find that trap sprung. Ho! ho!”

“Nay, listen,” said Bagheera. “The fever is out of my blood now. Let
them find ME there! Few would leave their houses after meeting me. It is
not the first time I have been in a cage; and I do not think they will
tie ME with cords.”

“Be wise, then,” said Mowgli, laughing; for he was beginning to feel as
reckless as the panther, who had glided into the hut.

“Pah!” Bagheera grunted. “This place is rank with Man, but here is just
such a bed as they gave me to lie upon in the King’s cages at Oodeypore.
Now I lie down.” Mowgli heard the strings of the cot crack under the
great brute’s weight. “By the Broken Lock that freed me, they will think
they have caught big game! Come and sit beside me, Little Brother; we
will give them ‘good hunting’ together!”

“No; I have another thought in my stomach. The Man-Pack shall not know
what share I have in the sport. Make thine own hunt. I do not wish to
see them.”

“Be it so,” said Bagheera. “Ah, now they come!”

The conference under the peepul-tree had been growing noisier and
noisier, at the far end of the village. It broke in wild yells, and
a rush up the street of men and women, waving clubs and bamboos and
sickles and knives. Buldeo and the Brahmin were at the head of it, but
the mob was close at their heels, and they cried, “The witch and the
wizard! Let us see if hot coins will make them confess! Burn the hut
over their heads! We will teach them to shelter wolf-devils! Nay, beat
them first! Torches! More torches! Buldeo, heat the gun-barrels!”

Here was some little difficulty with the catch of the door. It had been
very firmly fastened, but the crowd tore it away bodily, and the light
of the torches streamed into the room where, stretched at full length on
the bed, his paws crossed and lightly hung down over one end, black
as the Pit, and terrible as a demon, was Bagheera. There was one
half-minute of desperate silence, as the front ranks of the crowd clawed
and tore their way back from the threshold, and in that minute
Bagheera raised his head and yawned--elaborately, carefully, and
ostentatiously--as he would yawn when he wished to insult an equal.
The fringed lips drew back and up; the red tongue curled; the lower jaw
dropped and dropped till you could see half-way down the hot gullet; and
the gigantic dog-teeth stood clear to the pit of the gums till they rang
together, upper and under, with the snick of steel-faced wards shooting
home round the edges of a safe. Next instant the street was empty;
Bagheera had leaped back through the window, and stood at Mowgli’s
side, while a yelling, screaming torrent scrambled and tumbled one over
another in their panic haste to get to their own huts.

“They will not stir till day comes,” said Bagheera quietly. “And now?”

The silence of the afternoon sleep seemed to have overtaken the village;
but, as they listened, they could hear the sound of heavy grain-boxes
being dragged over earthen floors and set down against doors. Bagheera
was quite right; the village would not stir till daylight. Mowgli sat
still, and thought, and his face grew darker and darker.

“What have I done?” said Bagheera, at last coming to his feet, fawning.

“Nothing but great good. Watch them now till the day. I sleep.” Mowgli
ran off into the Jungle, and dropped like a dead man across a rock, and
slept and slept the day round, and the night back again.

When he waked, Bagheera was at his side, and there was a newly-killed
buck at his feet. Bagheera watched curiously while Mowgli went to work
with his skinning-knife, ate and drank, and turned over with his chin in
his hands.

“The man and the woman are come safe within eye-shot of Khanhiwara,”
 Bagheera said. “Thy lair mother sent the word back by Chil, the Kite.
They found a horse before midnight of the night they were freed, and
went very quickly. Is not that well?”

“That is well,” said Mowgli.

“And thy Man-Pack in the village did not stir till the sun was high this
morning. Then they ate their food and ran back quickly to their houses.”

“Did they, by chance, see thee?”

“It may have been. I was rolling in the dust before the gate at dawn,
and I may have made also some small song to myself. Now, Little Brother,
there is nothing more to do. Come hunting with me and Baloo. He has new
hives that he wishes to show, and we all desire thee back again as of
old. Take off that look which makes even me afraid! The man and woman
will not be put into the Red Flower, and all goes well in the Jungle. Is
it not true? Let us forget the Man-Pack.”

“They shall be forgotten in a little while. Where does Hathi feed
to-night?”

“Where he chooses. Who can answer for the Silent One? But why? What is
there Hathi can do which we cannot?”

“Bid him and his three sons come here to me.”

“But, indeed, and truly, Little Brother, it is not--it is not seemly
to say ‘Come,’ and ‘Go,’ to Hathi. Remember, he is the Master of the
Jungle, and before the Man-Pack changed the look on thy face, he taught
thee the Master-words of the Jungle.”

“That is all one. I have a Master-word for him now. Bid him come to
Mowgli, the Frog: and if he does not hear at first, bid him come because
of the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore.”

“The Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore,” Bagheera repeated two or three
times to make sure. “I go. Hathi can but be angry at the worst, and
I would give a moon’s hunting to hear a Master-word that compels the
Silent One.”

He went away, leaving Mowgli stabbing furiously with his skinning-knife
into the earth. Mowgli had never seen human blood in his life before
till he had seen, and--what meant much more to him--smelled Messua’s
blood on the thongs that bound her. And Messua had been kind to
him, and, so far as he knew anything about love, he loved Messua as
completely as he hated the rest of mankind. But deeply as he loathed
them, their talk, their cruelty, and their cowardice, not for anything
the Jungle had to offer could he bring himself to take a human life, and
have that terrible scent of blood back again in his nostrils. His plan
was simpler, but much more thorough; and he laughed to himself when he
thought that it was one of old Buldeo’s tales told under the peepul-tree
in the evening that had put the idea into his head.

“It WAS a Master-word,” Bagheera whispered in his ear. “They were
feeding by the river, and they obeyed as though they were bullocks. Look
where they come now!”

Hathi and his three sons had arrived, in their usual way, without a
sound. The mud of the river was still fresh on their flanks, and Hathi
was thoughtfully chewing the green stem of a young plantain-tree that he
had gouged up with his tusks. But every line in his vast body showed to
Bagheera, who could see things when he came across them, that it was not
the Master of the Jungle speaking to a Man-cub, but one who was afraid
coming before one who was not. His three sons rolled side by side,
behind their father.

Mowgli hardly lifted his head as Hathi gave him “Good hunting.” He kept
him swinging and rocking, and shifting from one foot to another, for
a long time before he spoke; and when he opened his mouth it was to
Bagheera, not to the elephants.

“I will tell a tale that was told to me by the hunter ye hunted to-day,”
 said Mowgli. “It concerns an elephant, old and wise, who fell into a
trap, and the sharpened stake in the pit scarred him from a little above
his heel to the crest of his shoulder, leaving a white mark.” Mowgli
threw out his hand, and as Hathi wheeled the moonlight showed a long
white scar on his slaty side, as though he had been struck with a
red-hot whip. “Men came to take him from the trap,” Mowgli continued,
“but he broke his ropes, for he was strong, and went away till his
wound was healed. Then came he, angry, by night to the fields of
those hunters. And I remember now that he had three sons. These things
happened many, many Rains ago, and very far away--among the fields of
Bhurtpore. What came to those fields at the next reaping, Hathi?”

“They were reaped by me and by my three sons,” said Hathi.

“And to the ploughing that follows the reaping?” said Mowgli.

“There was no ploughing,” said Hathi.

“And to the men that live by the green crops on the ground?” said
Mowgli.

“They went away.”

“And to the huts in which the men slept?” said Mowgli.

“We tore the roofs to pieces, and the Jungle swallowed up the walls,”
 said Hathi.

“And what more?” said Mowgli.

“As much good ground as I can walk over in two nights from the east to
the west, and from the north to the south as much as I can walk over in
three nights, the Jungle took. We let in the Jungle upon five villages;
and in those villages, and in their lands, the grazing-ground and the
soft crop-grounds, there is not one man to-day who takes his food from
the ground. That was the Sack of the Fields of Bhurtpore, which I and
my three sons did; and now I ask, Man-cub, how the news of it came to
thee?” said Hathi.

“A man told me, and now I see even Buldeo can speak truth. It was well
done, Hathi with the white mark; but the second time it shall be done
better, for the reason that there is a man to direct. Thou knowest the
village of the Man-Pack that cast me out? They are idle, senseless, and
cruel; they play with their mouths, and they do not kill the weaker for
food, but for sport. When they are full-fed they would throw their own
breed into the Red Flower. This I have seen. It is not well that they
should live here any more. I hate them!”

“Kill, then,” said the youngest of Hathi’s three sons, picking up a tuft
of grass, dusting it against his fore-legs, and throwing it away, while
his little red eyes glanced furtively from side to side.

“What good are white bones to me?” Mowgli answered angrily. “Am I the
cub of a wolf to play in the sun with a raw head? I have killed Shere
Khan, and his hide rots on the Council Rock; but--but I do not know
whither Shere Khan is gone, and my stomach is still empty. Now I
will take that which I can see and touch. Let in the Jungle upon that
village, Hathi!”

Bagheera shivered, and cowered down. He could understand, if the worst
came to the worst, a quick rush down the village street, and a right and
left blow into a crowd, or a crafty killing of men as they ploughed in
the twilight; but this scheme for deliberately blotting out an entire
village from the eyes of man and beast frightened him. Now he saw why
Mowgli had sent for Hathi. No one but the long-lived elephant could plan
and carry through such a war.

“Let them run as the men ran from the fields of Bhurtpore, till we have
the rain-water for the only plough, and the noise of the rain on the
thick leaves for the pattering of their spindles--till Bagheera and I
lair in the house of the Brahmin, and the buck drink at the tank behind
the temple! Let in the Jungle, Hathi!”

“But I--but we have no quarrel with them, and it needs the red rage
of great pain ere we tear down the places where men sleep,” said Hathi
doubtfully.

“Are ye the only eaters of grass in the Jungle? Drive in your peoples.
Let the deer and the pig and the nilghai look to it. Ye need never show
a hand’s-breadth of hide till the fields are naked. Let in the Jungle,
Hathi!”

“There will be no killing? My tusks were red at the Sack of the Fields
of Bhurtpore, and I would not wake that smell again.”

“Nor I. I do not wish even their bones to lie on the clean earth. Let
them go and find a fresh lair. They cannot stay here. I have seen and
smelled the blood of the woman that gave me food--the woman whom they
would have killed but for me. Only the smell of the new grass on their
door-steps can take away that smell. It burns in my mouth. Let in the
Jungle, Hathi!”

“Ah!” said Hathi. “So did the scar of the stake burn on my hide till we
watched the villages die under in the spring growth. Now I see. Thy war
shall be our war. We will let in the jungle!”

Mowgli had hardly time to catch his breath--he was shaking all over with
rage and hate before the place where the elephants had stood was empty,
and Bagheera was looking at him with terror.

“By the Broken Lock that freed me!” said the Black Panther at last. “Art
THOU the naked thing I spoke for in the Pack when all was young?
Master of the Jungle, when my strength goes, speak for me--speak for
Baloo--speak for us all! We are cubs before thee! Snapped twigs under
foot! Fawns that have lost their doe!”

The idea of Bagheera being a stray fawn upset Mowgli altogether, and he
laughed and caught his breath, and sobbed and laughed again, till he had
to jump into a pool to make himself stop. Then he swam round and round,
ducking in and out of the bars of the moonlight like the frog, his
namesake.

By this time Hathi and his three sons had turned, each to one point of
the compass, and were striding silently down the valleys a mile away.
They went on and on for two days’ march--that is to say, a long sixty
miles--through the Jungle; and every step they took, and every wave of
their trunks, was known and noted and talked over by Mang and Chil and
the Monkey People and all the birds. Then they began to feed, and fed
quietly for a week or so. Hathi and his sons are like Kaa, the Rock
Python. They never hurry till they have to.

At the end of that time--and none knew who had started it--a rumour went
through the Jungle that there was better food and water to be found in
such and such a valley. The pig--who, of course, will go to the ends of
the earth for a full meal--moved first by companies, scuffling over the
rocks, and the deer followed, with the small wild foxes that live on
the dead and dying of the herds; and the heavy-shouldered nilghai moved
parallel with the deer, and the wild buffaloes of the swamps came after
the nilghai. The least little thing would have turned the scattered,
straggling droves that grazed and sauntered and drank and grazed again;
but whenever there was an alarm some one would rise up and soothe them.
At one time it would be Ikki the Porcupine, full of news of good feed
just a little farther on; at another Mang would cry cheerily and flap
down a glade to show it was all empty; or Baloo, his mouth full of
roots, would shamble alongside a wavering line and half frighten, half
romp it clumsily back to the proper road. Very many creatures broke back
or ran away or lost interest, but very many were left to go forward. At
the end of another ten days or so the situation was this. The deer and
the pig and the nilghai were milling round and round in a circle of
eight or ten miles radius, while the Eaters of Flesh skirmished round
its edge. And the centre of that circle was the village, and round the
village the crops were ripening, and in the crops sat men on what they
call machans--platforms like pigeon-perches, made of sticks at the top
of four poles--to scare away birds and other stealers. Then the deer
were coaxed no more. The Eaters of Flesh were close behind them, and
forced them forward and inward.

It was a dark night when Hathi and his three sons slipped down from the
Jungle, and broke off the poles of the machans with their trunks; they
fell as a snapped stalk of hemlock in bloom falls, and the men that
tumbled from them heard the deep gurgling of the elephants in their
ears. Then the vanguard of the bewildered armies of the deer broke down
and flooded into the village grazing-grounds and the ploughed fields;
and the sharp-hoofed, rooting wild pig came with them, and what the deer
left the pig spoiled, and from time to time an alarm of wolves would
shake the herds, and they would rush to and fro desperately, treading
down the young barley, and cutting flat the banks of the irrigating
channels. Before the dawn broke the pressure on the outside of the
circle gave way at one point. The Eaters of Flesh had fallen back and
left an open path to the south, and drove upon drove of buck fled along
it. Others, who were bolder, lay up in the thickets to finish their meal
next night.

But the work was practically done. When the villagers looked in the
morning they saw their crops were lost. And that meant death if they did
not get away, for they lived year in and year out as near to starvation
as the Jungle was near to them. When the buffaloes were sent to graze
the hungry brutes found that the deer had cleared the grazing-grounds,
and so wandered into the Jungle and drifted off with their wild mates;
and when twilight fell the three or four ponies that belonged to the
village lay in their stables with their heads beaten in. Only Bagheera
could have given those strokes, and only Bagheera would have thought of
insolently dragging the last carcass to the open street.

The villagers had no heart to make fires in the fields that night, so
Hathi and his three sons went gleaning among what was left; and where
Hathi gleans there is no need to follow. The men decided to live on
their stored seed-corn until the rains had fallen, and then to take
work as servants till they could catch up with the lost year; but as
the grain-dealer was thinking of his well-filled crates of corn, and the
prices he would levy at the sale of it, Hathi’s sharp tusks were picking
out the corner of his mud-house, and smashing open the big wicker chest,
leeped with cow-dung, where the precious stuff lay.

When that last loss was discovered, it was the Brahmin’s turn to speak.
He had prayed to his own Gods without answer. It might be, he said,
that, unconsciously, the village had offended some one of the Gods of
the Jungle, for, beyond doubt, the Jungle was against them. So they sent
for the head-man of the nearest tribe of wandering Gonds--little, wise,
and very black hunters, living in the deep Jungle, whose fathers came of
the oldest race in India--the aboriginal owners of the land. They made
the Gond welcome with what they had, and he stood on one leg, his bow in
his hand, and two or three poisoned arrows stuck through his top-knot,
looking half afraid and half contemptuously at the anxious villagers
and their ruined fields. They wished to know whether his Gods--the Old
Gods--were angry with them and what sacrifices should be offered. The
Gond said nothing, but picked up a trail of the Karela, the vine that
bears the bitter wild gourd, and laced it to and fro across the temple
door in the face of the staring red Hindu image. Then he pushed with his
hand in the open air along the road to Khanhiwara, and went back to his
Jungle, and watched the Jungle People drifting through it. He knew that
when the Jungle moves only white men can hope to turn it aside.

There was no need to ask his meaning. The wild gourd would grow where
they had worshipped their God, and the sooner they saved themselves the
better.

But it is hard to tear a village from its moorings. They stayed on as
long as any summer food was left to them, and they tried to gather nuts
in the Jungle, but shadows with glaring eyes watched them, and rolled
before them even at mid-day; and when they ran back afraid to their
walls, on the tree-trunks they had passed not five minutes before the
bark would be stripped and chiselled with the stroke of some great
taloned paw. The more they kept to their village, the bolder grew the
wild things that gambolled and bellowed on the grazing-grounds by the
Waingunga. They had no time to patch and plaster the rear walls of the
empty byres that backed on to the Jungle; the wild pig trampled them
down, and the knotty-rooted vines hurried after and threw their elbows
over the new-won ground, and the coarse grass bristled behind the vines
like the lances of a goblin army following a retreat. The unmarried men
ran away first, and carried the news far and near that the village was
doomed. Who could fight, they said, against the Jungle, or the Gods
of the Jungle, when the very village cobra had left his hole in the
platform under the peepul-tree? So their little commerce with the
outside world shrunk as the trodden paths across the open grew fewer
and fainter. At last the nightly trumpetings of Hathi and his three sons
ceased to trouble them; for they had no more to be robbed of. The crop
on the ground and the seed in the ground had been taken. The outlying
fields were already losing their shape, and it was time to throw
themselves on the charity of the English at Khanhiwara.

Native fashion, they delayed their departure from one day to another
till the first Rains caught them and the unmended roofs let in a flood,
and the grazing-ground stood ankle deep, and all life came on with a
rush after the heat of the summer. Then they waded out--men, women,
and children--through the blinding hot rain of the morning, but turned
naturally for one farewell look at their homes.

They heard, as the last burdened family filed through the gate, a crash
of falling beams and thatch behind the walls. They saw a shiny,
snaky black trunk lifted for an instant, scattering sodden thatch. It
disappeared, and there was another crash, followed by a squeal. Hathi
had been plucking off the roofs of the huts as you pluck water-lilies,
and a rebounding beam had pricked him. He needed only this to unchain
his full strength, for of all things in the Jungle the wild elephant
enraged is the most wantonly destructive. He kicked backward at a mud
wall that crumbled at the stroke, and, crumbling, melted to yellow
mud under the torrent of rain. Then he wheeled and squealed, and tore
through the narrow streets, leaning against the huts right and left,
shivering the crazy doors, and crumpling up the caves; while his
three sons raged behind as they had raged at the Sack of the Fields of
Bhurtpore.

“The Jungle will swallow these shells,” said a quiet voice in the
wreckage. “It is the outer wall that must lie down,” and Mowgli, with
the rain sluicing over his bare shoulders and arms, leaped back from a
wall that was settling like a tired buffalo.

“All in good time,” panted Hathi. “Oh, but my tusks were red at
Bhurtpore; To the outer wall, children! With the head! Together! Now!”

The four pushed side by side; the outer wall bulged, split, and fell,
and the villagers, dumb with horror, saw the savage, clay-streaked
heads of the wreckers in the ragged gap. Then they fled, houseless and
foodless, down the valley, as their village, shredded and tossed and
trampled, melted behind them.

A month later the place was a dimpled mound, covered with soft, green
young stuff; and by the end of the Rains there was the roaring jungle in
full blast on the spot that had been under plough not six months before.




MOWGLI’S SONG AGAINST PEOPLE

     I will let loose against you the fleet-footed vines--
     I will call in the Jungle to stamp out your lines!
         The roofs shall fade before it,
           The house-beams shall fall,
         And the Karela, the bitter Karela,
           Shall cover it all!

     In the gates of these your councils my people shall sing,
     In the doors of these your garners the Bat-folk shall cling;
         And the snake shall be your watchman,
           By a hearthstone unswept;
         For the Karela, the bitter Karela,
           Shall fruit where ye slept!

     Ye shall not see my strikers; ye shall hear them and guess;
     By night, before the moon-rise, I will send for my cess,
         And the wolf shall be your herdsman
           By a landmark removed,
         For the Karela, the bitter Karela,
           Shall seed where ye loved!

     I will reap your fields before you at the hands of a host;
     Ye shall glean behind my reapers, for the bread that is lost,
         And the deer shall be your oxen
           By a headland untilled,
         For the Karela, the bitter Karela,
           Shall leaf where ye build!

     I have untied against you the club-footed vines,
     I have sent in the Jungle to swamp out your lines.
         The trees--the trees are on you!
           The house-beams shall fall,
         And the Karela, the bitter Karela,
            Shall cover you all!




THE UNDERTAKERS

        When ye say to Tabaqui, “My Brother!” when ye call the
            Hyena to meat,
        Ye may cry the Full Truce with Jacala--the Belly that runs
            on four feet.
                                                  Jungle Law

“Respect the aged!”

“It was a thick voice--a muddy voice that would have made you shudder--a
voice like something soft breaking in two. There was a quaver in it, a
croak and a whine.

“Respect the aged! O Companions of the River--respect the aged!”

Nothing could be seen on the broad reach of the river except a
little fleet of square-sailed, wooden-pinned barges, loaded with
building-stone, that had just come under the railway bridge, and were
driving down-stream. They put their clumsy helms over to avoid the
sand-bar made by the scour of the bridge-piers, and as they passed,
three abreast, the horrible voice began again:

“O Brahmins of the River--respect the aged and infirm!”

A boatman turned where he sat on the gunwale, lifted up his hand, said
something that was not a blessing, and the boats creaked on through
the twilight. The broad Indian river, that looked more like a chain
of little lakes than a stream, was as smooth as glass, reflecting the
sandy-red sky in mid-channel, but splashed with patches of yellow and
dusky purple near and under the low banks. Little creeks ran into the
river in the wet season, but now their dry mouths hung clear above
water-line. On the left shore, and almost under the railway bridge,
stood a mud-and-brick and thatch-and-stick village, whose main street,
full of cattle going back to their byres, ran straight to the river, and
ended in a sort of rude brick pier-head, where people who wanted to
wash could wade in step by step. That was the Ghaut of the village of
Mugger-Ghaut.

Night was falling fast over the fields of lentils and rice and cotton
in the low-lying ground yearly flooded by the river; over the reeds
that fringed the elbow of the bend, and the tangled jungle of the
grazing-grounds behind the still reeds. The parrots and crows, who had
been chattering and shouting over their evening drink, had flown inland
to roost, crossing the out-going battalions of the flying-foxes; and
cloud upon cloud of water-birds came whistling and “honking” to
the cover of the reed-beds. There were geese, barrel-headed and
black-backed, teal, widgeon, mallard, and sheldrake, with curlews, and
here and there a flamingo.

A lumbering Adjutant-crane brought up the rear, flying as though each
slow stroke would be his last.

“Respect the aged! Brahmins of the River--respect the aged!”

The Adjutant half turned his head, sheered a little in the direction of
the voice, and landed stiffly on the sand-bar below the bridge. Then you
saw what a ruffianly brute he really was. His back view was immensely
respectable, for he stood nearly six feet high, and looked rather like a
very proper bald-headed parson. In front it was different, for his Ally
Sloper-like head and neck had not a feather to them, and there was a
horrible raw-skin pouch on his neck under his chin--a hold-all for the
things his pick-axe beak might steal. His legs were long and thin and
skinny, but he moved them delicately, and looked at them with pride as
he preened down his ashy-gray tail-feathers, glanced over the smooth of
his shoulder, and stiffened into “Stand at attention.”

A mangy little Jackal, who had been yapping hungrily on a low bluff,
cocked up his ears and tail, and scuttered across the shallows to join
the Adjutant.

He was the lowest of his caste--not that the best of jackals are good
for much, but this one was peculiarly low, being half a beggar, half a
criminal--a cleaner-up of village rubbish-heaps, desperately timid or
wildly bold, everlastingly hungry, and full of cunning that never did
him any good.

“Ugh!” he said, shaking himself dolefully as he landed. “May the red
mange destroy the dogs of this village! I have three bites for each flea
upon me, and all because I looked--only looked, mark you--at an old shoe
in a cow-byre. Can I eat mud?” He scratched himself under his left ear.

“I heard,” said the Adjutant, in a voice like a blunt saw going through
a thick board--“I HEARD there was a new-born puppy in that same shoe.”

“To hear is one thing; to know is another,” said the Jackal, who had a
very fair knowledge of proverbs, picked up by listening to men round the
village fires of an evening.

“Quite true. So, to make sure, I took care of that puppy while the dogs
were busy elsewhere.”

“They were VERY busy,” said the Jackal. “Well, I must not go to the
village hunting for scraps yet awhile. And so there truly was a blind
puppy in that shoe?”

“It is here,” said the Adjutant, squinting over his beak at his full
pouch. “A small thing, but acceptable now that charity is dead in the
world.”

“Ahai! The world is iron in these days,” wailed the Jackal. Then his
restless eye caught the least possible ripple on the water, and he went
on quickly: “Life is hard for us all, and I doubt not that even our
excellent master, the Pride of the Ghaut and the Envy of the River----”

“A liar, a flatterer, and a Jackal were all hatched out of the same
egg,” said the Adjutant to nobody in particular; for he was rather a
fine sort of a liar on his own account when he took the trouble.

“Yes, the Envy of the River,” the Jackal repeated, raising his voice.
“Even he, I doubt not, finds that since the bridge has been built good
food is more scarce. But on the other hand, though I would by no means
say this to his noble face, he is so wise and so virtuous--as I, alas I
am not----”

“When the Jackal owns he is gray, how black must the Jackal be!”
 muttered the Adjutant. He could not see what was coming.

“That his food never fails, and in consequence----”

There was a soft grating sound, as though a boat had just touched in
shoal water. The Jackal spun round quickly and faced (it is always
best to face) the creature he had been talking about. It was a
twenty-four-foot crocodile, cased in what looked like treble-riveted
boiler-plate, studded and keeled and crested; the yellow points of his
upper teeth just overhanging his beautifully fluted lower jaw. It
was the blunt-nosed Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut, older than any man in the
village, who had given his name to the village; the demon of the ford
before the railway bridge, came--murderer, man-eater, and local fetish
in one. He lay with his chin in the shallows, keeping his place by an
almost invisible rippling of his tail, and well the Jackal knew that one
stroke of that same tail in the water would carry the Mugger up the bank
with the rush of a steam-engine.

“Auspiciously met, Protector of the Poor!” he fawned, backing at every
word. “A delectable voice was heard, and we came in the hopes of sweet
conversation. My tailless presumption, while waiting here, led me,
indeed, to speak of thee. It is my hope that nothing was overheard.”

Now the Jackal had spoken just to be listened to, for he knew flattery
was the best way of getting things to eat, and the Mugger knew that
the Jackal had spoken for this end, and the Jackal knew that the Mugger
knew, and the Mugger knew that the Jackal knew that the Mugger knew, and
so they were all very contented together.

The old brute pushed and panted and grunted up the bank, mumbling,
“Respect the aged and infirm!” and all the time his little eyes burned
like coals under the heavy, horny eyelids on the top of his triangular
head, as he shoved his bloated barrel-body along between his crutched
legs. Then he settled down, and, accustomed as the Jackal was to his
ways, he could not help starting, for the hundredth time, when he saw
how exactly the Mugger imitated a log adrift on the bar. He had even
taken pains to lie at the exact angle a naturally stranded log would
make with the water, having regard to the current of the season at the
time and place. All this was only a matter of habit, of course, because
the Mugger had come ashore for pleasure; but a crocodile is never quite
full, and if the Jackal had been deceived by the likeness he would not
have lived to philosophise over it.

“My child, I heard nothing,” said the Mugger, shutting one eye. “The
water was in my ears, and also I was faint with hunger. Since the
railway bridge was built my people at my village have ceased to love me;
and that is breaking my heart.”

“Ah, shame!” said the Jackal. “So noble a heart, too! But men are all
alike, to my mind.”

“Nay, there are very great differences indeed,” the Mugger answered
gently. “Some are as lean as boat-poles. Others again are fat as
young ja--dogs. Never would I causelessly revile men. They are of all
fashions, but the long years have shown me that, one with another, they
are very good. Men, women, and children--I have no fault to find with
them. And remember, child, he who rebukes the World is rebuked by the
World.”

“Flattery is worse than an empty tin can in the belly. But that which we
have just heard is wisdom,” said the Adjutant, bringing down one foot.

“Consider, though, their ingratitude to this excellent one,” began the
Jackal tenderly.

“Nay, nay, not ingratitude!” the Mugger said. “They do not think for
others; that is all. But I have noticed, lying at my station below the
ford, that the stairs of the new bridge are cruelly hard to climb, both
for old people and young children. The old, indeed, are not so worthy of
consideration, but I am grieved--I am truly grieved--on account of the
fat children. Still, I think, in a little while, when the newness of the
bridge has worn away, we shall see my people’s bare brown legs bravely
splashing through the ford as before. Then the old Mugger will be
honoured again.”

“But surely I saw Marigold wreaths floating off the edge of the Ghaut
only this noon,” said the Adjutant.

Marigold wreaths are a sign of reverence all India over.

“An error--an error. It was the wife of the sweetmeat-seller. She loses
her eyesight year by year, and cannot tell a log from me--the Mugger of
the Ghaut. I saw the mistake when she threw the garland, for I was lying
at the very foot of the Ghaut, and had she taken another step I might
have shown her some little difference. Yet she meant well, and we must
consider the spirit of the offering.”

“What good are marigold wreaths when one is on the rubbish-heap?” said
the Jackal, hunting for fleas, but keeping one wary eye on his Protector
of the Poor.

“True, but they have not yet begun to make the rubbish-heap that shall
carry ME. Five times have I seen the river draw back from the village
and make new land at the foot of the street. Five times have I seen the
village rebuilt on the banks, and I shall see it built yet five times
more. I am no faithless, fish-hunting Gavial, I, at Kasi to-day and
Prayag to-morrow, as the saying is, but the true and constant watcher of
the ford. It is not for nothing, child, that the village bears my name,
and ‘he who watches long,’ as the saying is, ‘shall at last have his
reward.’”

“_I_ have watched long--very long--nearly all my life, and my reward has
been bites and blows,” said the Jackal.

“Ho! ho! ho!” roared the Adjutant.

     “In August was the Jackal born;
        The Rains fell in September;
     ‘Now such a fearful flood as this,’
        Says he, ‘I can’t remember!’”

There is one very unpleasant peculiarity about the Adjutant. At
uncertain times he suffers from acute attacks of the fidgets or cramp
in his legs, and though he is more virtuous to behold than any of the
cranes, who are all immensely respectable, he flies off into wild,
cripple-stilt war-dances, half opening his wings and bobbing his bald
head up and down; while for reasons best known to himself he is very
careful to time his worst attacks with his nastiest remarks. At the last
word of his song he came to attention again, ten times adjutaunter than
before.

The Jackal winced, though he was full three seasons old, but you cannot
resent an insult from a person with a beak a yard long, and the power of
driving it like a javelin. The Adjutant was a most notorious coward, but
the Jackal was worse.

“We must live before we can learn,” said the Mugger, “and there is this
to say: Little jackals are very common, child, but such a mugger as I am
is not common. For all that, I am not proud, since pride is destruction;
but take notice, it is Fate, and against his Fate no one who swims or
walks or runs should say anything at all. I am well contented with Fate.
With good luck, a keen eye, and the custom of considering whether a
creek or a backwater has an outlet to it ere you ascend, much may be
done.”

“Once I heard that even the Protector of the Poor made a mistake,” said
the Jackal viciously.

“True; but there my Fate helped me. It was before I had come to my
full growth--before the last famine but three (by the Right and Left of
Gunga, how full used the streams to be in those days!). Yes, I was young
and unthinking, and when the flood came, who so pleased as I? A little
made me very happy then. The village was deep in flood, and I swam above
the Ghaut and went far inland, up to the rice-fields, and they were deep
in good mud. I remember also a pair of bracelets (glass they were,
and troubled me not a little) that I found that evening. Yes, glass
bracelets; and, if my memory serves me well, a shoe. I should have
shaken off both shoes, but I was hungry. I learned better later. Yes.
And so I fed and rested me; but when I was ready to go to the river
again the flood had fallen, and I walked through the mud of the main
street. Who but I? Came out all my people, priests and women and
children, and I looked upon them with benevolence. The mud is not a good
place to fight in. Said a boatman, ‘Get axes and kill him, for he is the
Mugger of the ford.’ ‘Not so,’ said the Brahmin. ‘Look, he is driving
the flood before him! He is the godling of the village.’ Then they
threw many flowers at me, and by happy thought one led a goat across the
road.”

“How good--how very good is goat!” said the Jackal.

“Hairy--too hairy, and when found in the water more than likely to hide
a cross-shaped hook. But that goat I accepted, and went down to the
Ghaut in great honour. Later, my Fate sent me the boatman who had
desired to cut off my tail with an axe. His boat grounded upon an old
shoal which you would not remember.”

“We are not ALL jackals here,” said the Adjutant. “Was it the shoal made
where the stone-boats sank in the year of the great drouth--a long shoal
that lasted three floods?”

“There were two,” said the Mugger; “an upper and a lower shoal.”

“Ay, I forgot. A channel divided them, and later dried up again,” said
the Adjutant, who prided himself on his memory.

“On the lower shoal my well-wisher’s craft grounded. He was sleeping in
the bows, and, half awake, leaped over to his waist--no, it was no more
than to his knees--to push off. His empty boat went on and touched again
below the next reach, as the river ran then. I followed, because I knew
men would come out to drag it ashore.”

“And did they do so?” said the Jackal, a little awe-stricken. This was
hunting on a scale that impressed him.

“There and lower down they did. I went no farther, but that gave me
three in one day--well-fed manjis (boatmen) all, and, except in the
case of the last (then I was careless), never a cry to warn those on the
bank.”

“Ah, noble sport! But what cleverness and great judgment it requires!”
 said the Jackal.

“Not cleverness, child, but only thought. A little thought in life
is like salt upon rice, as the boatmen say, and I have thought deeply
always. The Gavial, my cousin, the fish-eater, has told me how hard it
is for him to follow his fish, and how one fish differs from the other,
and how he must know them all, both together and apart. I say that is
wisdom; but, on the other hand, my cousin, the Gavial, lives among his
people. MY people do not swim in companies, with their mouths out of the
water, as Rewa does; nor do they constantly rise to the surface of the
water, and turn over on their sides, like Mohoo and little Chapta; nor
do they gather in shoals after flood, like Batchua and Chilwa.”

“All are very good eating,” said the Adjutant, clattering his beak.

“So my cousin says, and makes a great to-do over hunting them, but
they do not climb the banks to escape his sharp nose. MY people are
otherwise. Their life is on the land, in the houses, among the cattle.
I must know what they do, and what they are about to do; and adding the
tail to the trunk, as the saying is, I make up the whole elephant. Is
there a green branch and an iron ring hanging over a doorway? The old
Mugger knows that a boy has been born in that house, and must some
day come down to the Ghaut to play. Is a maiden to be married? The old
Mugger knows, for he sees the men carry gifts back and forth; and she,
too, comes down to the Ghaut to bathe before her wedding, and--he is
there. Has the river changed its channel, and made new land where there
was only sand before? The Mugger knows.”

“Now, of what use is that knowledge?” said the Jackal. “The river has
shifted even in my little life.” Indian rivers are nearly always moving
about in their beds, and will shift, sometimes, as much as two or three
miles in a season, drowning the fields on one bank, and spreading good
silt on the other.

“There is no knowledge so useful,” said the Mugger, “for new land means
new quarrels. The Mugger knows. Oho! the Mugger knows. As soon as the
water has drained off, he creeps up the little creeks that men think
would not hide a dog, and there he waits. Presently comes a farmer
saying he will plant cucumbers here, and melons there, in the new land
that the river has given him. He feels the good mud with his bare
toes. Anon comes another, saying he will put onions, and carrots, and
sugar-cane in such and such places. They meet as boats adrift meet,
and each rolls his eye at the other under the big blue turban. The old
Mugger sees and hears. Each calls the other ‘Brother,’ and they go to
mark out the boundaries of the new land. The Mugger hurries with them
from point to point, shuffling very low through the mud. Now they begin
to quarrel! Now they say hot words! Now they pull turbans! Now they lift
up their lathis (clubs), and, at last, one falls backward into the mud,
and the other runs away. When he comes back the dispute is settled, as
the iron-bound bamboo of the loser witnesses. Yet they are not grateful
to the Mugger. No, they cry ‘Murder!’ and their families fight with
sticks, twenty a-side. My people are good people--upland Jats--Malwais
of the Bet. They do not give blows for sport, and, when the fight is
done, the old Mugger waits far down the river, out of sight of the
village, behind the kikar-scrub yonder. Then come they down, my
broad-shouldered Jats--eight or nine together under the stars, bearing
the dead man upon a bed. They are old men with gray beards, and voices
as deep as mine. They light a little fire--ah! how well I know that
fire!--and they drink tobacco, and they nod their heads together forward
in a ring, or sideways toward the dead man upon the bank. They say the
English Law will come with a rope for this matter, and that such a man’s
family will be ashamed, because such a man must be hanged in the great
square of the Jail. Then say the friends of the dead, ‘Let him hang!’
and the talk is all to do over again--once, twice, twenty times in the
long night. Then says one, at last, ‘The fight was a fair fight. Let us
take blood-money, a little more than is offered by the slayer, and we
will say no more about it.’ Then do they haggle over the blood-money,
for the dead was a strong man, leaving many sons. Yet before amratvela
(sunrise) they put the fire to him a little, as the custom is, and the
dead man comes to me, and HE says no more about it. Aha! my children,
the Mugger knows--the Mugger knows--and my Malwah Jats are a good
people!”

“They are too close--too narrow in the hand for my crop,” croaked the
Adjutant. “They waste not the polish on the cow’s horn, as the saying
is; and, again, who can glean after a Malwai?”

“Ah, I--glean--THEM,” said the Mugger.

“Now, in Calcutta of the South, in the old days,” the Adjutant went on,
“everything was thrown into the streets, and we picked and chose. Those
wore dainty seasons. But to-day they keep their streets as clean as the
outside of an egg, and my people fly away. To be clean is one thing;
to dust, sweep, and sprinkle seven times a day wearies the very Gods
themselves.”

“There was a down-country jackal had it from a brother, who told me,
that in Calcutta of the South all the jackals were as fat as otters in
the Rains,” said the Jackal, his mouth watering at the bare thought of
it.

“Ah, but the white-faces are there--the English, and they bring dogs
from somewhere down the river in boats--big fat dogs--to keep those same
jackals lean,” said the Adjutant.

“They are, then, as hard-hearted as these people? I might have known.
Neither earth, sky, nor water shows charity to a jackal. I saw the tents
of a white-face last season, after the Rains, and I also took a new
yellow bridle to eat. The white-faces do not dress their leather in the
proper way. It made me very sick.”

“That was better than my case,” said the Adjutant. “When I was in my
third season, a young and a bold bird, I went down to the river where
the big boats come in. The boats of the English are thrice as big as
this village.”

“He has been as far as Delhi, and says all the people there walk on
their heads,” muttered the Jackal. The Mugger opened his left eye, and
looked keenly at the Adjutant.

“It is true,” the big bird insisted. “A liar only lies when he hopes
to be believed. No one who had not seen those boats COULD believe this
truth.”

“THAT is more reasonable,” said the Mugger. “And then?”

“From the insides of this boat they were taking out great pieces of
white stuff, which, in a little while, turned to water. Much split off,
and fell about on the shore, and the rest they swiftly put into a house
with thick walls. But a boatman, who laughed, took a piece no larger
than a small dog, and threw it to me. I--all my people--swallow without
reflection, and that piece I swallowed as is our custom. Immediately I
was afflicted with an excessive cold which, beginning in my crop, ran
down to the extreme end of my toes, and deprived me even of speech,
while the boatmen laughed at me. Never have I felt such cold. I danced
in my grief and amazement till I could recover my breath and then
I danced and cried out against the falseness of this world; and the
boatmen derided me till they fell down. The chief wonder of the matter,
setting aside that marvellous coldness, was that there was nothing at
all in my crop when I had finished my lamentings!”

The Adjutant had done his very best to describe his feelings after
swallowing a seven-pound lump of Wenham Lake ice, off an American
ice-ship, in the days before Calcutta made her ice by machinery; but
as he did not know what ice was, and as the Mugger and the Jackal knew
rather less, the tale missed fire.

“Anything,” said the Mugger, shutting his left eye again--“ANYTHING is
possible that comes out of a boat thrice the size of Mugger-Ghaut. My
village is not a small one.”

There was a whistle overhead on the bridge, and the Delhi Mail
slid across, all the carriages gleaming with light, and the shadows
faithfully following along the river. It clanked away into the dark
again; but the Mugger and the Jackal were so well used to it that they
never turned their heads.

“Is that anything less wonderful than a boat thrice the size of
Mugger-Ghaut?” said the bird, looking up.

“I saw that built, child. Stone by stone I saw the bridge-piers rise,
and when the men fell off (they were wondrous sure-footed for the most
part--but WHEN they fell) I was ready. After the first pier was made
they never thought to look down the stream for the body to burn. There,
again, I saved much trouble. There was nothing strange in the building
of the bridge,” said the Mugger.

“But that which goes across, pulling the roofed carts! That is strange,”
 the Adjutant repeated. “It is, past any doubt, a new breed of bullock.
Some day it will not be able to keep its foothold up yonder, and will
fall as the men did. The old Mugger will then be ready.”

The Jackal looked at the Adjutant and the Adjutant looked at the Jackal.
If there was one thing they were more certain of than another, it was
that the engine was everything in the wide world except a bullock. The
Jackal had watched it time and again from the aloe hedges by the side of
the line, and the Adjutant had seen engines since the first locomotive
ran in India. But the Mugger had only looked up at the thing from below,
where the brass dome seemed rather like a bullock’s hump.

“M--yes, a new kind of bullock,” the Mugger repeated ponderously,
to make himself quite sure in his own mind; and “Certainly it is a
bullock,” said the Jackal.

“And again it might be----” began the Mugger pettishly.

“Certainly--most certainly,” said the Jackal, without waiting for the
other to finish.

“What?” said the Mugger angrily, for he could feel that the others knew
more than he did. “What might it be? _I_ never finished my words. You
said it was a bullock.”

“It is anything the Protector of the Poor pleases. I am HIS servant--not
the servant of the thing that crosses the river.”

“Whatever it is, it is white-face work,” said the Adjutant; “and for my
own part, I would not lie out upon a place so near to it as this bar.”

“You do not know the English as I do,” said the Mugger. “There was a
white-face here when the bridge was built, and he would take a boat
in the evenings and shuffle with his feet on the bottom-boards, and
whisper: ‘Is he here? Is he there? Bring me my gun.’ I could hear him
before I could see him--each sound that he made--creaking and puffing
and rattling his gun, up and down the river. As surely as I had picked
up one of his workmen, and thus saved great expense in wood for the
burning, so surely would he come down to the Ghaut, and shout in a loud
voice that he would hunt me, and rid the river of me--the Mugger of
Mugger-Ghaut! ME! Children, I have swum under the bottom of his boat for
hour after hour, and heard him fire his gun at logs; and when I was well
sure he was wearied, I have risen by his side and snapped my jaws in his
face. When the bridge was finished he went away. All the English hunt in
that fashion, except when they are hunted.”

“Who hunts the white-faces?” yapped the Jackal excitedly.

“No one now, but I have hunted them in my time.”

“I remember a little of that Hunting. I was young then,” said the
Adjutant, clattering his beak significantly.

“I was well established here. My village was being builded for the third
time, as I remember, when my cousin, the Gavial, brought me word of rich
waters above Benares. At first I would not go, for my cousin, who is a
fish-eater, does not always know the good from the bad; but I heard my
people talking in the evenings, and what they said made me certain.”

“And what did they say?” the Jackal asked.

“They said enough to make me, the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut, leave water
and take to my feet. I went by night, using the littlest streams as they
served me; but it was the beginning of the hot weather, and all streams
were low. I crossed dusty roads; I went through tall grass; I climbed
hills in the moonlight. Even rocks did I climb, children--consider this
well. I crossed the tail of Sirhind, the waterless, before I could
find the set of the little rivers that flow Gungaward. I was a month’s
journey from my own people and the river that I knew. That was very
marvellous!”

“What food on the way?” said the Jackal, who kept his soul in his little
stomach, and was not a bit impressed by the Mugger’s land travels.

“That which I could find--COUSIN,” said the Mugger slowly, dragging each
word.

Now you do not call a man a cousin in India unless you think you can
establish some kind of blood-relationship, and as it is only in old
fairy-tales that the Mugger ever marries a jackal, the Jackal knew for
what reason he had been suddenly lifted into the Mugger’s family circle.
If they had been alone he would not have cared, but the Adjutant’s eyes
twinkled with mirth at the ugly jest.

“Assuredly, Father, I might have known,” said the Jackal. A mugger
does not care to be called a father of jackals, and the Mugger of
Mugger-Ghaut said as much--and a great deal more which there is no use
in repeating here.

“The Protector of the Poor has claimed kinship. How can I remember the
precise degree? Moreover, we eat the same food. He has said it,” was the
Jackal’s reply.

That made matters rather worse, for what the Jackal hinted at was that
the Mugger must have eaten his food on that land-march fresh and fresh
every day, instead of keeping it by him till it was in a fit and proper
condition, as every self-respecting mugger and most wild beasts do when
they can. Indeed, one of the worst terms of contempt along the River-bed
is “eater of fresh meat.” It is nearly as bad as calling a man a
cannibal.

“That food was eaten thirty seasons ago,” said the Adjutant quietly. “If
we talk for thirty seasons more it will never come back. Tell us, now,
what happened when the good waters were reached after thy most wonderful
land journey. If we listened to the howling of every jackal the business
of the town would stop, as the saying is.”

The Mugger must have been grateful for the interruption, because he went
on, with a rush:

“By the Right and Left of Gunga! when I came there never did I see such
waters!”

“Were they better, then, than the big flood of last season?” said the
Jackal.

“Better! That flood was no more than comes every five years--a handful
of drowned strangers, some chickens, and a dead bullock in muddy water
with cross-currents. But the season I think of, the river was low,
smooth, and even, and, as the Gavial had warned me, the dead English
came down, touching each other. I got my girth in that season--my
girth and my depth. From Agra, by Etawah and the broad waters by
Allahabad----”

“Oh, the eddy that set under the walls of the fort at Allahabad!” said
the Adjutant. “They came in there like widgeon to the reeds, and round
and round they swung--thus!”

He went off into his horrible dance again, while the Jackal looked on
enviously. He naturally could not remember the terrible year of the
Mutiny they were talking about. The Mugger continued:

“Yes, by Allahabad one lay still in the slack-water and let twenty go
by to pick one; and, above all, the English were not cumbered with
jewellery and nose-rings and anklets as my women are nowadays. To
delight in ornaments is to end with a rope for a necklace, as the saying
is. All the muggers of all the rivers grew fat then, but it was my Fate
to be fatter than them all. The news was that the English were being
hunted into the rivers, and by the Right and Left of Gunga! we believed
it was true. So far as I went south I believed it to be true; and I went
down-stream beyond Monghyr and the tombs that look over the river.”

“I know that place,” said the Adjutant. “Since those days Monghyr is a
lost city. Very few live there now.”

“Thereafter I worked up-stream very slowly and lazily, and a little
above Monghyr there came down a boatful of white-faces--alive! They
were, as I remember, women, lying under a cloth spread over sticks, and
crying aloud. There was never a gun fired at us, the watchers of the
fords in those days. All the guns were busy elsewhere. We could hear
them day and night inland, coming and going as the wind shifted. I rose
up full before the boat, because I had never seen white-faces alive,
though I knew them well--otherwise. A naked white child kneeled by the
side of the boat, and, stooping over, must needs try to trail his hands
in the river. It is a pretty thing to see how a child loves running
water. I had fed that day, but there was yet a little unfilled space
within me. Still, it was for sport and not for food that I rose at the
child’s hands. They were so clear a mark that I did not even look when I
closed; but they were so small that though my jaws rang true--I am sure
of that--the child drew them up swiftly, unhurt. They must have passed
between tooth and tooth--those small white hands. I should have caught
him cross-wise at the elbows; but, as I said, it was only for sport and
desire to see new things that I rose at all. They cried out one after
another in the boat, and presently I rose again to watch them. The boat
was too heavy to push over. They were only women, but he who trusts
a woman will walk on duckweed in a pool, as the saying is: and by the
Right and Left of Gunga, that is truth!”

“Once a woman gave me some dried skin from a fish,” said the Jackal. “I
had hoped to get her baby, but horse-food is better than the kick of a
horse, as the saying is. What did thy woman do?”

“She fired at me with a short gun of a kind I have never seen before or
since. Five times, one after another” (the Mugger must have met with an
old-fashioned revolver); “and I stayed open-mouthed and gaping, my head
in the smoke. Never did I see such a thing. Five times, as swiftly as I
wave my tail--thus!”

The Jackal, who had been growing more and more interested in the story,
had just time to leap back as the huge tail swung by like a scythe.

“Not before the fifth shot,” said the Mugger, as though he had never
dreamed of stunning one of his listeners--“not before the fifth shot
did I sink, and I rose in time to hear a boatman telling all those
white women that I was most certainly dead. One bullet had gone under
a neck-plate of mine. I know not if it is there still, for the reason I
cannot turn my head. Look and see, child. It will show that my tale is
true.”

“I?” said the Jackal. “Shall an eater of old shoes, a bone-cracker,
presume, to doubt the word of the Envy of the River? May my tail be
bitten off by blind puppies if the shadow of such a thought has crossed
my humble mind! The Protector of the Poor has condescended to inform me,
his slave, that once in his life he has been wounded by a woman. That is
sufficient, and I will tell the tale to all my children, asking for no
proof.”

“Over-much civility is sometimes no better than over-much discourtesy,
for, as the saying is, one can choke a guest with curds. I do NOT desire
that any children of thine should know that the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut
took his only wound from a woman. They will have much else to think of
if they get their meat as miserably as does their father.”

“It is forgotten long ago! It was never said! There never was a white
woman! There was no boat! Nothing whatever happened at all.”

The Jackal waved his brush to show how completely everything was wiped
out of his memory, and sat down with an air.

“Indeed, very many things happened,” said the Mugger, beaten in his
second attempt that night to get the better of his friend. (Neither bore
malice, however. Eat and be eaten was fair law along the river, and the
Jackal came in for his share of plunder when the Mugger had finished
a meal.) “I left that boat and went up-stream, and, when I had reached
Arrah and the back-waters behind it, there were no more dead English.
The river was empty for a while. Then came one or two dead, in red
coats, not English, but of one kind all--Hindus and Purbeeahs--then five
and six abreast, and at last, from Arrah to the North beyond Agra, it
was as though whole villages had walked into the water. They came out
of little creeks one after another, as the logs come down in the Rains.
When the river rose they rose also in companies from the shoals they
had rested upon; and the falling flood dragged them with it across the
fields and through the Jungle by the long hair. All night, too, going
North, I heard the guns, and by day the shod feet of men crossing fords,
and that noise which a heavy cart-wheel makes on sand under water; and
every ripple brought more dead. At last even I was afraid, for I said:
‘If this thing happen to men, how shall the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut
escape?’ There were boats, too, that came up behind me without sails,
burning continually, as the cotton-boats sometimes burn, but never
sinking.”

“Ah!” said the Adjutant. “Boats like those come to Calcutta of the
South. They are tall and black, they beat up the water behind them with
a tail, and they----”

“Are thrice as big as my village. MY boats were low and white; they beat
up the water on either side of them and were no larger than the boats
of one who speaks truth should be. They made me very afraid, and I
left water and went back to this my river, hiding by day and walking
by night, when I could not find little streams to help me. I came to
my village again, but I did not hope to see any of my people there.
Yet they were ploughing and sowing and reaping, and going to and fro in
their fields, as quietly as their own cattle.”

“Was there still good food in the river?” said the Jackal.

“More than I had any desire for. Even I--and I do not eat mud--even
I was tired, and, as I remember, a little frightened of this constant
coming down of the silent ones. I heard my people say in my village
that all the English were dead; but those that came, face down, with the
current were NOT English, as my people saw. Then my people said that it
was best to say nothing at all, but to pay the tax and plough the land.
After a long time the river cleared, and those that came down it had
been clearly drowned by the floods, as I could well see; and though it
was not so easy then to get food, I was heartily glad of it. A little
killing here and there is no bad thing--but even the Mugger is sometimes
satisfied, as the saying is.”

“Marvellous! Most truly marvellous!” said the Jackal. “I am become fat
through merely hearing about so much good eating. And afterward what, if
it be permitted to ask, did the Protector of the Poor do?”

“I said to myself--and by the Right and Left of Gunga! I locked my jaws
on that vow--I said I would never go roving any more. So I lived by the
Ghaut, very close to my own people, and I watched over them year after
year; and they loved me so much that they threw marigold wreaths at my
head whenever they saw it lift. Yes, and my Fate has been very kind to
me, and the river is good enough to respect my poor and infirm presence;
only----”

“No one is all happy from his beak to his tail,” said the Adjutant
sympathetically. “What does the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut need more?”

“That little white child which I did not get,” said the Mugger, with a
deep sigh. “He was very small, but I have not forgotten. I am old now,
but before I die it is my desire to try one new thing. It is true they
are a heavy-footed, noisy, and foolish people, and the sport would be
small, but I remember the old days above Benares, and, if the child
lives, he will remember still. It may be he goes up and down the bank
of some river, telling how he once passed his hands between the teeth of
the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut, and lived to make a tale of it. My Fate has
been very kind, but that plagues me sometimes in my dreams--the thought
of the little white child in the bows of that boat.” He yawned, and
closed his jaws. “And now I will rest and think. Keep silent, my
children, and respect the aged.”

He turned stiffly, and shuffled to the top of the sand-bar, while the
Jackal drew back with the Adjutant to the shelter of a tree stranded on
the end nearest the railway bridge.

“That was a pleasant and profitable life,” he grinned, looking up
inquiringly at the bird who towered above him. “And not once, mark you,
did he think fit to tell me where a morsel might have been left along
the banks. Yet I have told HIM a hundred times of good things wallowing
down-stream. How true is the saying, ‘All the world forgets the Jackal
and the Barber when the news has been told!’ Now he is going to sleep!
Arrh!”

“How can a jackal hunt with a Mugger?” said the Adjutant coolly. “Big
thief and little thief; it is easy to say who gets the pickings.”

The Jackal turned, whining impatiently, and was going to curl himself
up under the tree-trunk, when suddenly he cowered, and looked up through
the draggled branches at the bridge almost above his head.

“What now?” said the Adjutant, opening his wings uneasily.

“Wait till we see. The wind blows from us to them, but they are not
looking for us--those two men.”

“Men, is it? My office protects me. All India knows I am holy.” The
Adjutant, being a first-class scavenger, is allowed to go where he
pleases, and so this one never flinched.

“I am not worth a blow from anything better than an old shoe,” said the
Jackal, and listened again. “Hark to that footfall!” he went on. “That
was no country leather, but the shod foot of a white-face. Listen
again! Iron hits iron up there! It is a gun! Friend, those heavy-footed,
foolish English are coming to speak with the Mugger.”

“Warn him, then. He was called Protector of the Poor by some one not
unlike a starving Jackal but a little time ago.”

“Let my cousin protect his own hide. He has told me again and again
there is nothing to fear from the white-faces. They must be white-faces.
Not a villager of Mugger-Ghaut would dare to come after him. See, I said
it was a gun! Now, with good luck, we shall feed before daylight. He
cannot hear well out of water, and--this time it is not a woman!”

A shiny barrel glittered for a minute in the moonlight on the girders.
The Mugger was lying on the sand-bar as still as his own shadow, his
fore-feet spread out a little, his head dropped between them, snoring
like a--mugger.

A voice on the bridge whispered: “It’s an odd shot--straight down
almost--but as safe as houses. Better try behind the neck. Golly! what
a brute! The villagers will be wild if he’s shot, though. He’s the deota
[godling] of these parts.”

“Don’t care a rap,” another voice answered; “he took about fifteen of my
best coolies while the bridge was building, and it’s time he was put
a stop to. I’ve been after him in a boat for weeks. Stand by with the
Martini as soon as I’ve given him both barrels of this.”

“Mind the kick, then. A double four-bore’s no joke.”

“That’s for him to decide. Here goes!”

There was a roar like the sound of a small cannon (the biggest sort of
elephant-rifle is not very different from some artillery), and a double
streak of flame, followed by the stinging crack of a Martini, whose long
bullet makes nothing of a crocodile’s plates. But the explosive bullets
did the work. One of them struck just behind the Mugger’s neck, a
hand’s-breadth to the left of the backbone, while the other burst a
little lower down, at the beginning of the tail. In ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred a mortally-wounded crocodile can scramble to deep water
and get away; but the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut was literally broken into
three pieces. He hardly moved his head before the life went out of him,
and he lay as flat as the Jackal.

“Thunder and lightning! Lightning and thunder!” said that miserable
little beast. “Has the thing that pulls the covered carts over the
bridge tumbled at last?”

“It is no more than a gun,” said the Adjutant, though his very
tail-feathers quivered. “Nothing more than a gun. He is certainly dead.
Here come the white-faces.”

The two Englishmen had hurried down from the bridge and across to the
sand-bar, where they stood admiring the length of the Mugger. Then a
native with an axe cut off the big head, and four men dragged it across
the spit.

“The last time that I had my hand in a Mugger’s mouth,” said one of the
Englishmen, stooping down (he was the man who had built the bridge), “it
was when I was about five years old--coming down the river by boat to
Monghyr. I was a Mutiny baby, as they call it. Poor mother was in the
boat, too, and she often told me how she fired dad’s old pistol at the
beast’s head.”

“Well, you’ve certainly had your revenge on the chief of the clan--even
if the gun has made your nose bleed. Hi, you boatmen! Haul that head up
the bank, and we’ll boil it for the skull. The skin’s too knocked about
to keep. Come along to bed now. This was worth sitting up all night for,
wasn’t it?”

*****

Curiously enough, the Jackal and the Adjutant made the very same remark
not three minutes after the men had left.




A RIPPLE SONG

     Once a ripple came to land
       In the golden sunset burning--
     Lapped against a maiden’s hand,
       By the ford returning.

     Dainty foot and gentle breast--
       Here, across, be glad and rest.
     “Maiden, wait,” the ripple saith.
       “Wait awhile, for I am Death!”

     “Where my lover calls I go--
       Shame it were to treat him coldly--
     ‘Twas a fish that circled so,
       Turning over boldly.”

     Dainty foot and tender heart,
       Wait the loaded ferry-cart.
     “Wait, ah, wait!” the ripple saith;
       “Maiden, wait, for I am Death!”

     “When my lover calls I haste--
       Dame Disdain was never wedded!”
      Ripple-ripple round her waist,
       Clear the current eddied.

     Foolish heart and faithful hand,
       Little feet that touched no land.
     Far away the ripple sped,
       Ripple--ripple--running red!




THE KING’S ANKUS

     These are the Four that are never content, that have never
         been filled since the Dews began--
     Jacala’s mouth, and the glut of the Kite, and the hands of the
         Ape, and the Eyes of Man.
                                 Jungle Saying.

Kaa, the big Rock Python, had changed his skin for perhaps the
two-hundredth time since his birth; and Mowgli, who never forgot that
he owed his life to Kaa for a night’s work at Cold Lairs, which you may
perhaps remember, went to congratulate him. Skin-changing always makes
a snake moody and depressed till the new skin begins to shine and look
beautiful. Kaa never made fun of Mowgli any more, but accepted him, as
the other Jungle People did, for the Master of the Jungle, and brought
him all the news that a python of his size would naturally hear. What
Kaa did not know about the Middle Jungle, as they call it,--the life
that runs close to the earth or under it, the boulder, burrow, and
the tree-bole life,--might have been written upon the smallest of his
scales.

That afternoon Mowgli was sitting in the circle of Kaa’s great coils,
fingering the flaked and broken old skin that lay all looped and twisted
among the rocks just as Kaa had left it. Kaa had very courteously packed
himself under Mowgli’s broad, bare shoulders, so that the boy was really
resting in a living arm-chair.

“Even to the scales of the eyes it is perfect,” said Mowgli, under his
breath, playing with the old skin. “Strange to see the covering of one’s
own head at one’s own feet!”

“Ay, but I lack feet,” said Kaa; “and since this is the custom of all
my people, I do not find it strange. Does thy skin never feel old and
harsh?”

“Then go I and wash, Flathead; but, it is true, in the great heats I
have wished I could slough my skin without pain, and run skinless.”

“I wash, and ALSO I take off my skin. How looks the new coat?”

Mowgli ran his hand down the diagonal checkerings of the immense back.
“The Turtle is harder-backed, but not so gay,” he said judgmatically.
“The Frog, my name-bearer, is more gay, but not so hard. It is very
beautiful to see--like the mottling in the mouth of a lily.”

“It needs water. A new skin never comes to full colour before the first
bath. Let us go bathe.”

“I will carry thee,” said Mowgli; and he stooped down, laughing, to
lift the middle section of Kaa’s great body, just where the barrel was
thickest. A man might just, as well have tried to heave up a two-foot
water-main; and Kaa lay still, puffing with quiet amusement. Then the
regular evening game began--the Boy in the flush of his great strength,
and the Python in his sumptuous new skin, standing up one against the
other for a wrestling match--a trial of eye and strength. Of course,
Kaa could have crushed a dozen Mowglis if he had let himself go; but he
played carefully, and never loosed one-tenth of his power. Ever since
Mowgli was strong enough to endure a little rough handling, Kaa had
taught him this game, and it suppled his limbs as nothing else could.
Sometimes Mowgli would stand lapped almost to his throat in Kaa’s
shifting coils, striving to get one arm free and catch him by
the throat. Then Kaa would give way limply, and Mowgli, with both
quick-moving feet, would try to cramp the purchase of that huge tail as
it flung backward feeling for a rock or a stump. They would rock to
and fro, head to head, each waiting for his chance, till the beautiful,
statue-like group melted in a whirl of black-and-yellow coils and
struggling legs and arms, to rise up again and again. “Now! now! now!”
 said Kaa, making feints with his head that even Mowgli’s quick hand
could not turn aside. “Look! I touch thee here, Little Brother! Here,
and here! Are thy hands numb? Here again!”

The game always ended in one way--with a straight, driving blow of the
head that knocked the boy over and over. Mowgli could never learn the
guard for that lightning lunge, and, as Kaa said, there was not the
least use in trying.

“Good hunting!” Kaa grunted at last; and Mowgli, as usual, was shot away
half a dozen yards, gasping and laughing. He rose with his fingers full
of grass, and followed Kaa to the wise snake’s pet bathing-place--a
deep, pitchy-black pool surrounded with rocks, and made interesting by
sunken tree-stumps. The boy slipped in, Jungle-fashion, without a sound,
and dived across; rose, too, without a sound, and turned on his back,
his arms behind his head, watching the moon rising above the rocks,
and breaking up her reflection in the water with his toes. Kaa’s
diamond-shaped head cut the pool like a razor, and came out to rest
on Mowgli’s shoulder. They lay still, soaking luxuriously in the cool
water.

“It is VERY good,” said Mowgli at last, sleepily. “Now, in the Man-Pack,
at this hour, as I remember, they laid them down upon hard pieces of
wood in the inside of a mud-trap, and, having carefully shut out all the
clean winds, drew foul cloth over their heavy heads and made evil songs
through their noses. It is better in the Jungle.”

A hurrying cobra slipped down over a rock and drank, gave them “Good
hunting!” and went away.

“Sssh!” said Kaa, as though he had suddenly remembered something. “So
the Jungle gives thee all that thou hast ever desired, Little Brother?”

“Not all,” said Mowgli, laughing; “else there would be a new and strong
Shere Khan to kill once a moon. Now, I could kill with my own hands,
asking no help of buffaloes. And also I have wished the sun to shine in
the middle of the Rains, and the Rains to cover the sun in the deep of
summer; and also I have never gone empty but I wished that I had killed
a goat; and also I have never killed a goat but I wished it had been
buck; nor buck but I wished it had been nilghai. But thus do we feel,
all of us.”

“Thou hast no other desire?” the big snake demanded.

“What more can I wish? I have the Jungle, and the favour of the Jungle!
Is there more anywhere between sunrise and sunset?”

“Now, the Cobra said----” Kaa began. “What cobra? He that went away just
now said nothing. He was hunting.”

“It was another.”

“Hast thou many dealings with the Poison People? I give them their own
path. They carry death in the fore-tooth, and that is not good--for they
are so small. But what hood is this thou hast spoken with?”

Kaa rolled slowly in the water like a steamer in a beam sea. “Three or
four moons since,” said he, “I hunted in Cold Lairs, which place thou
hast not forgotten. And the thing I hunted fled shrieking past the tanks
and to that house whose side I once broke for thy sake, and ran into the
ground.”

“But the people of Cold Lairs do not live in burrows.” Mowgli knew that
Kaa was telling of the Monkey People.

“This thing was not living, but seeking to live,” Kaa replied, with
a quiver of his tongue. “He ran into a burrow that led very far. I
followed, and having killed, I slept. When I waked I went forward.”

“Under the earth?”

“Even so, coming at last upon a White Hood [a white cobra], who spoke of
things beyond my knowledge, and showed me many things I had never before
seen.”

“New game? Was it good hunting?” Mowgli turned quickly on his side.

“It was no game, and would have broken all my teeth; but the White Hood
said that a man--he spoke as one that knew the breed--that a man would
give the breath under his ribs for only the sight of those things.”

“We will look,” said Mowgli. “I now remember that I was once a man.”

“Slowly--slowly. It was haste killed the Yellow Snake that ate the sun.
We two spoke together under the earth, and I spoke of thee, naming thee
as a man. Said the White Hood (and he is indeed as old as the Jungle):
‘It is long since I have seen a man. Let him come, and he shall see all
these things, for the least of which very many men would die.’”

“That MUST be new game. And yet the Poison People do not tell us when
game is afoot. They are an unfriendly folk.”

“It is NOT game. It is--it is--I cannot say what it is.”

“We will go there. I have never seen a White Hood, and I wish to see the
other things. Did he kill them?”

“They are all dead things. He says he is the keeper of them all.”

“Ah! As a wolf stands above meat he has taken to his own lair. Let us
go.”

Mowgli swam to bank, rolled on the grass to dry himself, and the two
set off for Cold Lairs, the deserted city of which you may have heard.
Mowgli was not the least afraid of the Monkey People in those days,
but the Monkey People had the liveliest horror of Mowgli. Their tribes,
however, were raiding in the Jungle, and so Cold Lairs stood empty and
silent in the moonlight. Kaa led up to the ruins of the queens’ pavilion
that stood on the terrace, slipped over the rubbish, and dived down
the half-choked staircase that went underground from the centre of
the pavilion. Mowgli gave the snake-call,--“We be of one blood, ye and
I,”--and followed on his hands and knees. They crawled a long distance
down a sloping passage that turned and twisted several times, and at
last came to where the root of some great tree, growing thirty feet
overhead, had forced out a solid stone in the wall. They crept through
the gap, and found themselves in a large vault, whose domed roof had
been also broken away by tree-roots so that a few streaks of light
dropped down into the darkness.

“A safe lair,” said Mowgli, rising to his firm feet, “but over-far to
visit daily. And now what do we see?”

“Am I nothing?” said a voice in the middle of the vault; and Mowgli saw
something white move till, little by little, there stood up the hugest
cobra he had ever set eyes on--a creature nearly eight feet long,
and bleached by being in darkness to an old ivory-white. Even the
spectacle-marks of his spread hood had faded to faint yellow. His eyes
were as red as rubies, and altogether he was most wonderful.

“Good hunting!” said Mowgli, who carried his manners with his knife, and
that never left him.

“What of the city?” said the White Cobra, without answering the
greeting. “What of the great, the walled city--the city of a hundred
elephants and twenty thousand horses, and cattle past counting--the city
of the King of Twenty Kings? I grow deaf here, and it is long since I
heard their war-gongs.”

“The Jungle is above our heads,” said Mowgli. “I know only Hathi and his
sons among elephants. Bagheera has slain all the horses in one village,
and--what is a King?”

“I told thee,” said Kaa softly to the Cobra,--“I told thee, four moons
ago, that thy city was not.”

“The city--the great city of the forest whose gates are guarded by the
King’s towers--can never pass. They builded it before my father’s father
came from the egg, and it shall endure when my son’s sons are as white
as I! Salomdhi, son of Chandrabija, son of Viyeja, son of Yegasuri, made
it in the days of Bappa Rawal. Whose cattle are YE?”

“It is a lost trail,” said Mowgli, turning to Kaa. “I know not his
talk.”

“Nor I. He is very old. Father of Cobras, there is only the Jungle here,
as it has been since the beginning.”

“Then who is HE,” said the White Cobra, “sitting down before me,
unafraid, knowing not the name of the King, talking our talk through a
man’s lips? Who is he with the knife and the snake’s tongue?”

“Mowgli they call me,” was the answer. “I am of the Jungle. The wolves
are my people, and Kaa here is my brother. Father of Cobras, who art
thou?”

“I am the Warden of the King’s Treasure. Kurrun Raja builded the stone
above me, in the days when my skin was dark, that I might teach death
to those who came to steal. Then they let down the treasure through the
stone, and I heard the song of the Brahmins my masters.”

“Umm!” said Mowgli to himself. “I have dealt with one Brahmin already,
in the Man-Pack, and--I know what I know. Evil comes here in a little.”

“Five times since I came here has the stone been lifted, but always to
let down more, and never to take away. There are no riches like these
riches--the treasures of a hundred kings. But it is long and long since
the stone was last moved, and I think that my city has forgotten.”

“There is no city. Look up. Yonder are roots of the great trees tearing
the stones apart. Trees and men do not grow together,” Kaa insisted.

“Twice and thrice have men found their way here,” the White Cobra
answered savagely; “but they never spoke till I came upon them groping
in the dark, and then they cried only a little time. But ye come with
lies, Man and Snake both, and would have me believe the city is not, and
that my wardship ends. Little do men change in the years. But I change
never! Till the stone is lifted, and the Brahmins come down singing the
songs that I know, and feed me with warm milk, and take me to the light
again, I--I--_I_, and no other, am the Warden of the King’s Treasure!
The city is dead, ye say, and here are the roots of the trees? Stoop
down, then, and take what ye will. Earth has no treasure like to these.
Man with the snake’s tongue, if thou canst go alive by the way that thou
hast entered it, the lesser Kings will be thy servants!”

“Again the trail is lost,” said Mowgli coolly. “Can any jackal have
burrowed so deep and bitten this great White Hood? He is surely mad.
Father of Cobras, I see nothing here to take away.”

“By the Gods of the Sun and Moon, it is the madness of death upon the
boy!” hissed the Cobra. “Before thine eyes close I will allow thee this
favour. Look thou, and see what man has never seen before!”

“They do not well in the Jungle who speak to Mowgli of favours,” said
the boy, between his teeth; “but the dark changes all, as I know. I will
look, if that please thee.”

He stared with puckered-up eyes round the vault, and then lifted up from
the floor a handful of something that glittered.

“Oho!” said he, “this is like the stuff they play with in the Man-Pack:
only this is yellow and the other was brown.”

He let the gold pieces fall, and move forward. The floor of the vault
was buried some five or six feet deep in coined gold and silver that had
burst from the sacks it had been originally stored in, and, in the long
years, the metal had packed and settled as sand packs at low tide. On it
and in it and rising through it, as wrecks lift through the sand, were
jewelled elephant-howdahs of embossed silver, studded with plates of
hammered gold, and adorned with carbuncles and turquoises. There were
palanquins and litters for carrying queens, framed and braced with
silver and enamel, with jade-handled poles and amber curtain-rings;
there were golden candlesticks hung with pierced emeralds that quivered
on the branches; there were studded images, five feet high, of forgotten
gods, silver with jewelled eyes; there were coats of mail, gold inlaid
on steel, and fringed with rotted and blackened seed-pearls; there
were helmets, crested and beaded with pigeon’s-blood rubies; there were
shields of lacquer, of tortoise-shell and rhinoceros-hide, strapped
and bossed with red gold and set with emeralds at the edge; there were
sheaves of diamond-hilted swords, daggers, and hunting-knives; there
were golden sacrificial bowls and ladles, and portable altars of a shape
that never sees the light of day; there were jade cups and bracelets;
there were incense-burners, combs, and pots for perfume, henna, and
eye-powder, all in embossed gold; there were nose-rings, armlets,
head-bands, finger-rings, and girdles past any counting; there were
belts, seven fingers broad, of square-cut diamonds and rubies, and
wooden boxes, trebly clamped with iron, from which the wood had fallen
away in powder, showing the pile of uncut star-sapphires, opals,
cat’s-eyes, sapphires, rubies, diamonds, emeralds, and garnets within.

The White Cobra was right. No mere money would begin to pay the value of
this treasure, the sifted pickings of centuries of war, plunder, trade,
and taxation. The coins alone were priceless, leaving out of count all
the precious stones; and the dead weight of the gold and silver alone
might be two or three hundred tons. Every native ruler in India to-day,
however poor, has a hoard to which he is always adding; and though, once
in a long while, some enlightened prince may send off forty or fifty
bullock-cart loads of silver to be exchanged for Government securities,
the bulk of them keep their treasure and the knowledge of it very
closely to themselves.

But Mowgli naturally did not understand what these things meant. The
knives interested him a little, but they did not balance so well as
his own, and so he dropped them. At last he found something really
fascinating laid on the front of a howdah half buried in the coins.
It was a three-foot ankus, or elephant-goad--something like a small
boat-hook. The top was one round, shining ruby, and eight inches of
the handle below it were studded with rough turquoises close together,
giving a most satisfactory grip. Below them was a rim of jade with a
flower-pattern running round it--only the leaves were emeralds, and
the blossoms were rubies sunk in the cool, green stone. The rest of
the handle was a shaft of pure ivory, while the point--the spike and
hook--was gold-inlaid steel with pictures of elephant-catching; and the
pictures attracted Mowgli, who saw that they had something to do with
his friend Hathi the Silent.

The White Cobra had been following him closely.

“Is this not worth dying to behold?” he said. “Have I not done thee a
great favour?”

“I do not understand,” said Mowgli. “The things are hard and cold, and
by no means good to eat. But this”--he lifted the ankus--“I desire to
take away, that I may see it in the sun. Thou sayest they are all thine?
Wilt thou give it to me, and I will bring thee frogs to eat?”

The White Cobra fairly shook with evil delight. “Assuredly I will give
it,” he said. “All that is here I will give thee--till thou goest away.”

“But I go now. This place is dark and cold, and I wish to take the
thorn-pointed thing to the Jungle.”

“Look by thy foot! What is that there?” Mowgli picked up something white
and smooth. “It is the bone of a man’s head,” he said quietly. “And here
are two more.”

“They came to take the treasure away many years ago. I spoke to them in
the dark, and they lay still.”

“But what do I need of this that is called treasure? If thou wilt
give me the ankus to take away, it is good hunting. If not, it is good
hunting none the less. I do not fight with the Poison People, and I was
also taught the Master-word of thy tribe.”

“There is but one Master-word here. It is mine!”

Kaa flung himself forward with blazing eyes. “Who bade me bring the
Man?” he hissed.

“I surely,” the old Cobra lisped. “It is long since I have seen Man, and
this Man speaks our tongue.”

“But there was no talk of killing. How can I go to the Jungle and say
that I have led him to his death?” said Kaa.

“I talk not of killing till the time. And as to thy going or not going,
there is the hole in the wall. Peace, now, thou fat monkey-killer! I
have but to touch thy neck, and the Jungle will know thee no longer.
Never Man came here that went away with the breath under his ribs. I am
the Warden of the Treasure of the King’s City!”

“But, thou white worm of the dark, I tell thee there is neither king nor
city! The Jungle is all about us!” cried Kaa.

“There is still the Treasure. But this can be done. Wait awhile, Kaa of
the Rocks, and see the boy run. There is room for great sport here. Life
is good. Run to and fro awhile, and make sport, boy!”

Mowgli put his hand on Kaa’s head quietly.

“The white thing has dealt with men of the Man-Pack until now. He does
not know me,” he whispered. “He has asked for this hunting. Let him have
it.” Mowgli had been standing with the ankus held point down. He flung
it from him quickly and it dropped crossways just behind the great
snake’s hood, pinning him to the floor. In a flash, Kaa’s weight was
upon the writhing body, paralysing it from hood to tail. The red eyes
burned, and the six spare inches of the head struck furiously right and
left.

“Kill!” said Kaa, as Mowgli’s hand went to his knife.

“No,” he said, as he drew the blade; “I will never kill again save for
food. But look you, Kaa!” He caught the snake behind the hood, forced
the mouth open with the blade of the knife, and showed the terrible
poison-fangs of the upper jaw lying black and withered in the gum. The
White Cobra had outlived his poison, as a snake will.

“THUU” (“It is dried up”--Literally, a rotted out tree-stump), said
Mowgli; and motioning Kaa away, he picked up the ankus, setting the
White Cobra free.

“The King’s Treasure needs a new Warden,” he said gravely. “Thuu, thou
hast not done well. Run to and fro and make sport, Thuu!”

“I am ashamed. Kill me!” hissed the White Cobra.

“There has been too much talk of killing. We will go now. I take the
thorn-pointed thing, Thuu, because I have fought and worsted thee.”

“See, then, that the thing does not kill thee at last. It is Death!
Remember, it is Death! There is enough in that thing to kill the men of
all my city. Not long wilt thou hold it, Jungle Man, nor he who takes it
from thee. They will kill, and kill, and kill for its sake! My strength
is dried up, but the ankus will do my work. It is Death! It is Death! It
is Death!”

Mowgli crawled out through the hole into the passage again, and the last
that he saw was the White Cobra striking furiously with his harmless
fangs at the stolid golden faces of the gods that lay on the floor, and
hissing, “It is Death!”

They were glad to get to the light of day once more; and when they
were back in their own Jungle and Mowgli made the ankus glitter in the
morning light, he was almost as pleased as though he had found a bunch
of new flowers to stick in his hair.

“This is brighter than Bagheera’s eyes,” he said delightedly, as he
twirled the ruby. “I will show it to him; but what did the Thuu mean
when he talked of death?”

“I cannot say. I am sorrowful to my tail’s tail that he felt not thy
knife. There is always evil at Cold Lairs--above ground or below. But
now I am hungry. Dost thou hunt with me this dawn?” said Kaa.

“No; Bagheera must see this thing. Good hunting!” Mowgli danced off,
flourishing the great ankus, and stopping from time to time to admire
it, till he came to that part of the Jungle Bagheera chiefly used,
and found him drinking after a heavy kill. Mowgli told him all his
adventures from beginning to end, and Bagheera sniffed at the ankus
between whiles. When Mowgli came to the White Cobra’s last words, the
Panther purred approvingly.

“Then the White Hood spoke the thing which is?” Mowgli asked quickly.

“I was born in the King’s cages at Oodeypore, and it is in my stomach
that I know some little of Man. Very many men would kill thrice in a
night for the sake of that one big red stone alone.”

“But the stone makes it heavy to the hand. My little bright knife is
better; and--see! the red stone is not good to eat. Then WHY would they
kill?”

“Mowgli, go thou and sleep. Thou hast lived among men, and----”

“I remember. Men kill because they are not hunting;--for idleness and
pleasure. Wake again, Bagheera. For what use was this thorn-pointed
thing made?”

Bagheera half opened his eyes--he was very sleepy--with a malicious
twinkle.

“It was made by men to thrust into the head of the sons of Hathi, so
that the blood should pour out. I have seen the like in the street of
Oodeypore, before our cages. That thing has tasted the blood of many
such as Hathi.”

“But why do they thrust into the heads of elephants?”

“To teach them Man’s Law. Having neither claws nor teeth, men make these
things--and worse.”

“Always more blood when I come near, even to the things the Man-Pack
have made,” said Mowgli disgustedly. He was getting a little tired of
the weight of the ankus. “If I had known this, I would not have taken
it. First it was Messua’s blood on the thongs, and now it is Hathi’s. I
will use it no more. Look!”

The ankus flew sparkling, and buried itself point down thirty yards
away, between the trees. “So my hands are clean of Death,” said Mowgli,
rubbing his palms on the fresh, moist earth. “The Thuu said Death would
follow me. He is old and white and mad.”

“White or black, or death or life, _I_ am going to sleep, Little
Brother. I cannot hunt all night and howl all day, as do some folk.”

Bagheera went off to a hunting-lair that he knew, about two miles off.
Mowgli made an easy way for himself up a convenient tree, knotted three
or four creepers together, and in less time than it takes to tell was
swinging in a hammock fifty feet above ground. Though he had no positive
objection to strong daylight, Mowgli followed the custom of his
friends, and used it as little as he could. When he waked among the very
loud-voiced peoples that live in the trees, it was twilight once more,
and he had been dreaming of the beautiful pebbles he had thrown away.

“At least I will look at the thing again,” he said, and slid down a
creeper to the earth; but Bagheera was before him. Mowgli could hear him
snuffing in the half light.

“Where is the thorn-pointed thing?” cried Mowgli.

“A man has taken it. Here is the trail.”

“Now we shall see whether the Thuu spoke truth. If the pointed thing is
Death, that man will die. Let us follow.”

“Kill first,” said Bagheera. “An empty stomach makes a careless eye. Men
go very slowly, and the Jungle is wet enough to hold the lightest mark.”

They killed as soon as they could, but it was nearly three hours before
they finished their meat and drink and buckled down to the trail. The
Jungle People know that nothing makes up for being hurried over your
meals.

“Think you the pointed thing will turn in the man’s hand and kill him?”
 Mowgli asked. “The Thuu said it was Death.”

“We shall see when we find,” said Bagheera, trotting with his head low.
“It is single-foot” (he meant that there was only one man), “and the
weight of the thing has pressed his heel far into the ground.”

“Hai! This is as clear as summer lightning,” Mowgli answered; and they
fell into the quick, choppy trail-trot in and out through the checkers
of the moonlight, following the marks of those two bare feet.

“Now he runs swiftly,” said Mowgli. “The toes are spread apart.” They
went on over some wet ground. “Now why does he turn aside here?”

“Wait!” said Bagheera, and flung himself forward with one superb bound
as far as ever he could. The first thing to do when a trail ceases to
explain itself is to cast forward without leaving, your own confusing
foot-marks on the ground. Bagheera turned as he landed, and faced
Mowgli, crying, “Here comes another trail to meet him. It is a smaller
foot, this second trail, and the toes turn inward.”

Then Mowgli ran up and looked. “It is the foot of a Gond hunter,” he
said. “Look! Here he dragged his bow on the grass. That is why the first
trail turned aside so quickly. Big Foot hid from Little Foot.”

“That is true,” said Bagheera. “Now, lest by crossing each other’s
tracks we foul the signs, let each take one trail. I am Big Foot, Little
Brother, and thou art Little Foot, the Gond.”

Bagheera leaped back to the original trail, leaving Mowgli stooping
above the curious narrow track of the wild little man of the woods.

“Now,” said Bagheera, moving step by step along the chain of footprints,
“I, Big Foot, turn aside here. Now I hide me behind a rock and stand
still, not daring to shift my feet. Cry thy trail, Little Brother.”

“Now, I, Little Foot, come to the rock,” said Mowgli, running up his
trail. “Now, I sit down under the rock, leaning upon my right hand, and
resting my bow between my toes. I wait long, for the mark of my feet is
deep here.”

“I also,” said Bagheera, hidden behind the rock. “I wait, resting the end
of the thorn-pointed thing upon a stone. It slips, for here is a scratch
upon the stone. Cry thy trail, Little Brother.”

“One, two twigs and a big branch are broken here,” said Mowgli, in an
undertone. “Now, how shall I cry THAT? Ah! It is plain now. I, Little
Foot, go away making noises and tramplings so that Big Foot may hear
me.” He moved away from the rock pace by pace among the trees, his
voice rising in the distance as he approached a little cascade. “I--go,
far--away--to--where--the--noise--of--falling-water--covers--my--noise;
and--here--I--wait. Cry thy trail, Bagheera, Big Foot!”

The panther had been casting in every direction to see how Big Foot’s
trail led away from behind the rock. Then he gave tongue:

“I come from behind the rock upon my knees, dragging the thorn-pointed
thing. Seeing no one, I run. I, Big Foot, run swiftly. The trail is
clear. Let each follow his own. I run!”

Bagheera swept on along the clearly-marked trail, and Mowgli followed
the steps of the Gond. For some time there was silence in the Jungle.

“Where art thou, Little Foot?” cried Bagheera. Mowgli’s voice answered
him not fifty yards to the right.

“Um!” said the Panther, with a deep cough. “The two run side by side,
drawing nearer!”

They raced on another half-mile, always keeping about the same distance,
till Mowgli, whose head was not so close to the ground as Bagheera’s,
cried: “They have met. Good hunting--look! Here stood Little Foot, with
his knee on a rock--and yonder is Big Foot indeed!”

Not ten yards in front of them, stretched across a pile of broken rocks,
lay the body of a villager of the district, a long, small-feathered Gond
arrow through his back and breast.

“Was the Thuu so old and so mad, Little Brother?” said Bagheera gently.
“Here is one death, at least.”

“Follow on. But where is the drinker of elephant’s blood--the red-eyed
thorn?”

“Little Foot has it--perhaps. It is single-foot again now.”

The single trail of a light man who had been running quickly and bearing
a burden on his left shoulder held on round a long, low spur of dried
grass, where each footfall seemed, to the sharp eyes of the trackers,
marked in hot iron.

Neither spoke till the trail ran up to the ashes of a camp-fire hidden
in a ravine.

“Again!” said Bagheera, checking as though he had been turned into
stone.

The body of a little wizened Gond lay with its feet in the ashes, and
Bagheera looked inquiringly at Mowgli.

“That was done with a bamboo,” said the boy, after one glance. “I have
used such a thing among the buffaloes when I served in the Man-Pack.
The Father of Cobras--I am sorrowful that I made a jest of him--knew
the breed well, as I might have known. Said I not that men kill for
idleness?”

“Indeed, they killed for the sake of the red and blue stones,” Bagheera
answered. “Remember, I was in the King’s cages at Oodeypore.”

“One, two, three, four tracks,” said Mowgli, stooping over the ashes.
“Four tracks of men with shod feet. They do not go so quickly as Gonds.
Now, what evil had the little woodman done to them? See, they talked
together, all five, standing up, before they killed him. Bagheera, let
us go back. My stomach is heavy in me, and yet it heaves up and down
like an oriole’s nest at the end of a branch.”

“It is not good hunting to leave game afoot. Follow!” said the panther.
“Those eight shod feet have not gone far.”

No more was said for fully an hour, as they worked up the broad trail of
the four men with shod feet.

It was clear, hot daylight now, and Bagheera said, “I smell smoke.”

Men are always more ready to eat than to run, Mowgli answered, trotting
in and out between the low scrub bushes of the new Jungle they were
exploring. Bagheera, a little to his left, made an indescribable noise
in his throat.

“Here is one that has done with feeding,” said he. A tumbled bundle
of gay-coloured clothes lay under a bush, and round it was some spilt
flour.

“That was done by the bamboo again,” said Mowgli. “See! that white dust
is what men eat. They have taken the kill from this one,--he carried
their food,--and given him for a kill to Chil, the Kite.”

“It is the third,” said Bagheera.

“I will go with new, big frogs to the Father of Cobras, and feed him
fat,” said Mowgli to himself. “The drinker of elephant’s blood is Death
himself--but still I do not understand!”

“Follow!” said Bagheera.

They had not gone half a mile farther when they heard Ko, the Crow,
singing the death-song in the top of a tamarisk under whose shade three
men were lying. A half-dead fire smoked in the centre of the circle,
under an iron plate which held a blackened and burned cake of unleavened
bread. Close to the fire, and blazing in the sunshine, lay the
ruby-and-turquoise ankus.

“The thing works quickly; all ends here,” said Bagheera. “How did THESE
die, Mowgli? There is no mark on any.”

A Jungle-dweller gets to learn by experience as much as many doctors
know of poisonous plants and berries. Mowgli sniffed the smoke that came
up from the fire, broke off a morsel of the blackened bread, tasted it,
and spat it out again.

“Apple of Death,” he coughed. “The first must have made it ready in the
food for THESE, who killed him, having first killed the Gond.”

“Good hunting, indeed! The kills follow close,” said Bagheera.

“Apple of Death” is what the Jungle call thorn-apple or dhatura, the
readiest poison in all India.

“What now?” said the panther. “Must thou and I kill each other for
yonder red-eyed slayer?”

“Can it speak?” said Mowgli in a whisper. “Did I do it a wrong when I
threw it away? Between us two it can do no wrong, for we do not desire
what men desire. If it be left here, it will assuredly continue to kill
men one after another as fast as nuts fall in a high wind. I have no
love to men, but even I would not have them die six in a night.”

“What matter? They are only men. They killed one another, and were well
pleased,” said Bagheera. “That first little woodman hunted well.”

“They are cubs none the less; and a cub will drown himself to bite the
moon’s light on the water. The fault was mine,” said Mowgli, who spoke
as though he knew all about everything. “I will never again bring into
the Jungle strange things--not though they be as beautiful as flowers.
This”--he handled the ankus gingerly--“goes back to the Father of
Cobras. But first we must sleep, and we cannot sleep near these
sleepers. Also we must bury HIM, lest he run away and kill another six.
Dig me a hole under that tree.”

“But, Little Brother,” said Bagheera, moving off to the spot, “I tell
thee it is no fault of the blood-drinker. The trouble is with the men.”

“All one,” said Mowgli. “Dig the hole deep. When we wake I will take him
up and carry him back.”

*****

Two nights later, as the White Cobra sat mourning in the darkness of
the vault, ashamed, and robbed, and alone, the turquoise ankus whirled
through the hole in the wall, and clashed on the floor of golden coins.

“Father of Cobras,” said Mowgli (he was careful to keep the other side
of the wall), “get thee a young and ripe one of thine own people to help
thee guard the King’s Treasure, so that no man may come away alive any
more.”

“Ah-ha! It returns, then. I said the thing was Death. How comes it that
thou art still alive?” the old Cobra mumbled, twining lovingly round the
ankus-haft.

“By the Bull that bought me, I do not know! That thing has killed six
times in a night. Let him go out no more.”




THE SONG OF THE LITTLE HUNTER

     Ere Mor the Peacock flutters, ere the Monkey People cry,
       Ere Chil the Kite swoops down a furlong sheer,
     Through the Jungle very softly flits a shadow and a sigh--
       He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear!

     Very softly down the glade runs a waiting, watching shade,
       And the whisper spreads and widens far and near;
     And the sweat is on thy brow, for he passes even now--
       He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear!

     Ere the moon has climbed the mountain, ere the rocks
           are ribbed with light,
       When the downward-dipping trails are dank and drear,
     Comes a breathing hard behind thee--snuffle-snuffle
           through the night--
       It is Fear, O Little Hunter, it is Fear!

     On thy knees and draw the bow; bid the shrilling arrow go;
       In the empty, mocking thicket plunge the spear;
     But thy hands are loosed and weak, and the blood has left
           thy cheek--
       It is Fear, O Little Hunter, it is Fear!

     When the heat-cloud sucks the tempest, when the slivered
           pine-trees fall,
       When the blinding, blaring rain-squalls lash and veer;
     Through the war-gongs of the thunder rings a voice more
           loud than all--
       It is Fear, O Little Hunter, it is Fear!

     Now the spates are banked and deep; now the footless
           boulders leap--
       Now the lightning shows each littlest leaf-rib clear--
     But thy throat is shut and dried, and thy heart against
           thy side
       Hammers: Fear, O Little Hunter--this is Fear!




QUIQUERN

     The People of the Eastern Ice, they are melting like the snow--
     They beg for coffee and sugar; they go where the white men go.
     The People of the Western Ice, they learn to steal and fight;
     “They sell their furs to the trading-post: they sell their souls
         to the white.
     The People of the Southern Ice, they trade with the whaler’s
     crew;
     Their women have many ribbons, but their tents are torn and few.
     But the People of the Elder Ice, beyond the white man’s ken--
     Their spears are made of the narwhal-horn, and they are the
         last of the Men!
                                         Translation.

“He has opened his eyes. Look!”

“Put him in the skin again. He will be a strong dog. On the fourth month
we will name him.”

“For whom?” said Amoraq.

Kadlu’s eye rolled round the skin-lined snow-house till it fell on
fourteen-year-old Kotuko sitting on the sleeping-bench, making a button
out of walrus ivory. “Name him for me,” said Kotuko, with a grin. “I
shall need him one day.”

Kadlu grinned back till his eyes were almost buried in the fat of his
flat cheeks, and nodded to Amoraq, while the puppy’s fierce mother
whined to see her baby wriggling far out of reach in the little sealskin
pouch hung above the warmth of the blubber-lamp. Kotuko went on with his
carving, and Kadlu threw a rolled bundle of leather dog-harnesses into a
tiny little room that opened from one side of the house, slipped off his
heavy deerskin hunting-suit, put it into a whalebone-net that hung above
another lamp, and dropped down on the sleeping-bench to whittle at
a piece of frozen seal-meat till Amoraq, his wife, should bring the
regular dinner of boiled meat and blood-soup. He had been out since
early dawn at the seal-holes, eight miles away, and had come home with
three big seal. Half-way down the long, low snow passage or tunnel
that led to the inner door of the house you could hear snappings and
yelpings, as the dogs of his sleigh-team, released from the day’s work,
scuffled for warm places.

When the yelpings grew too loud Kotuko lazily rolled off the
sleeping-bench, and picked up a whip with an eighteen-inch handle of
springy whalebone, and twenty-five feet of heavy, plaited thong. He
dived into the passage, where it sounded as though all the dogs were
eating him alive; but that was no more than their regular grace before
meals. When he crawled out at the far end, half a dozen furry heads
followed him with their eyes as he went to a sort of gallows of
whale-jawbones, from which the dog’s meat was hung; split off the frozen
stuff in big lumps with a broad-headed spear; and stood, his whip in
one hand and the meat in the other. Each beast was called by name, the
weakest first, and woe betide any dog that moved out of his turn; for
the tapering lash would shoot out like thonged lightning, and flick away
an inch or so of hair and hide. Each beast growled, snapped, choked once
over his portion, and hurried back to the protection of the passage,
while the boy stood upon the snow under the blazing Northern Lights and
dealt out justice. The last to be served was the big black leader of
the team, who kept order when the dogs were harnessed; and to him Kotuko
gave a double allowance of meat as well as an extra crack of the whip.

“Ah!” said Kotuko, coiling up the lash, “I have a little one over the
lamp that will make a great many howlings. SARPOK! Get in!”

He crawled back over the huddled dogs, dusted the dry snow from his
furs with the whalebone beater that Amoraq kept by the door, tapped the
skin-lined roof of the house to shake off any icicles that might have
fallen from the dome of snow above, and curled up on the bench. The
dogs in the passage snored and whined in their sleep, the boy-baby in
Amoraq’s deep fur hood kicked and choked and gurgled, and the mother of
the newly-named puppy lay at Kotuko’s side, her eyes fixed on the bundle
of sealskin, warm and safe above the broad yellow flame of the lamp.

And all this happened far away to the north, beyond Labrador, beyond
Hudson’s Strait, where the great tides heave the ice about, north of
Melville Peninsula--north even of the narrow Fury and Hecla Straits--on
the north shore of Baffin Land, where Bylot’s Island stands above the
ice of Lancaster Sound like a pudding-bowl wrong side up. North of
Lancaster Sound there is little we know anything about, except North
Devon and Ellesmere Land; but even there live a few scattered people,
next door, as it were, to the very Pole.

Kadlu was an Inuit,--what you call an Esquimau,--and his tribe, some
thirty persons all told, belonged to the Tununirmiut--“the country lying
at the back of something.” In the maps that desolate coast is written
Navy Board Inlet, but the Inuit name is best, because the country lies
at the very back of everything in the world. For nine months of the year
there is only ice and snow, and gale after gale, with a cold that no
one can realise who has never seen the thermometer even at zero. For six
months of those nine it is dark; and that is what makes it so horrible.
In the three months of the summer it only freezes every other day and
every night, and then the snow begins to weep off on the southerly
slopes, and a few ground-willows put out their woolly buds, a tiny
stonecrop or so makes believe to blossom, beaches of fine gravel and
rounded stones run down to the open sea, and polished boulders and
streaked rocks lift up above the granulated snow. But all that is gone
in a few weeks, and the wild winter locks down again on the land; while
at sea the ice tears up and down the offing, jamming and ramming, and
splitting and hitting, and pounding and grounding, till it all freezes
together, ten feet thick, from the land outward to deep water.

In the winter Kadlu would follow the seal to the edge of this land-ice,
and spear them as they came up to breathe at their blow-holes. The
seal must have open water to live and catch fish in, and in the deep of
winter the ice would sometimes run eighty miles without a break from the
nearest shore. In the spring he and his people retreated from the floes
to the rocky mainland, where they put up tents of skins, and snared the
sea-birds, or speared the young seal basking on the beaches. Later, they
would go south into Baffin Land after the reindeer, and to get their
year’s store of salmon from the hundreds of streams and lakes of the
interior; coming back north in September or October for the musk-ox
hunting and the regular winter sealery. This travelling was done with
dog-sleighs, twenty and thirty miles a day, or sometimes down the coast
in big skin “woman-boats,” when the dogs and the babies lay among the
feet of the rowers, and the women sang songs as they glided from cape to
cape over the glassy, cold waters. All the luxuries that the Tununirmiut
knew came from the south--driftwood for sleigh-runners, rod-iron for
harpoon-tips, steel knives, tin kettles that cooked food much better
than the old soap-stone affairs, flint and steel, and even matches, as
well as coloured ribbons for the women’s hair, little cheap mirrors,
and red cloth for the edging of deerskin dress-jackets. Kadlu traded the
rich, creamy, twisted narwhal horn and musk-ox teeth (these are just
as valuable as pearls) to the Southern Inuit, and they, in turn, traded
with the whalers and the missionary-posts of Exeter and Cumberland
Sounds; and so the chain went on, till a kettle picked up by a ship’s
cook in the Bhendy Bazaar might end its days over a blubber-lamp
somewhere on the cool side of the Arctic Circle.

Kadlu, being a good hunter, was rich in iron harpoons, snow-knives,
bird-darts, and all the other things that make life easy up there in the
great cold; and he was the head of his tribe, or, as they say, “the
man who knows all about it by practice.” This did not give him any
authority, except now and then he could advise his friends to change
their hunting-grounds; but Kotuko used it to domineer a little, in the
lazy, fat Inuit fashion, over the other boys, when they came out at
night to play ball in the moonlight, or to sing the Child’s Song to the
Aurora Borealis.

But at fourteen an Inuit feels himself a man, and Kotuko was tired of
making snares for wild-fowl and kit-foxes, and most tired of all of
helping the women to chew seal-and deer-skins (that supples them as
nothing else can) the long day through, while the men were out hunting.
He wanted to go into the quaggi, the Singing-House, when the hunters
gathered there for their mysteries, and the angekok, the sorcerer,
frightened them into the most delightful fits after the lamps were put
out, and you could hear the Spirit of the Reindeer stamping on the roof;
and when a spear was thrust out into the open black night it came back
covered with hot blood. He wanted to throw his big boots into the net
with the tired air of the head of a family, and to gamble with the
hunters when they dropped in of an evening and played a sort of
home-made roulette with a tin pot and a nail. There were hundreds of
things that he wanted to do, but the grown men laughed at him and said,
“Wait till you have been in the buckle, Kotuko. Hunting is not ALL
catching.”

Now that his father had named a puppy for him, things looked brighter.
An Inuit does not waste a good dog on his son till the boy knows
something of dog-driving; and Kotuko was more than sure that he knew
more than everything.

If the puppy had not had an iron constitution he would have died from
over-stuffing and over-handling. Kotuko made him a tiny harness with a
trace to it, and hauled him all over the house-floor, shouting: “Aua!
Ja aua!” (Go to the right). “Choiachoi! Ja choiachoi!” (Go to the left).
“Ohaha!” (Stop). The puppy did not like it at all, but being fished for
in this way was pure happiness beside being put to the sleigh for the
first time. He just sat down on the snow, and played with the seal-hide
trace that ran from his harness to the pitu, the big thong in the bows
of the sleigh. Then the team started, and the puppy found the heavy
ten-foot sleigh running up his back, and dragging him along the snow,
while Kotuko laughed till the tears ran down his face. There followed
days and days of the cruel whip that hisses like the wind over ice, and
his companions all bit him because he did not know his work, and the
harness chafed him, and he was dot allowed to sleep with Kotuko any
more, but had to take the coldest place in the passage. It was a sad
time for the puppy.

The boy learned, too, as fast as the dog; though a dog-sleigh is a
heart-breaking thing to manage. Each beast is harnessed, the weakest
nearest to the driver, by his own separate trace, which runs under
his left fore-leg to the main thong, where it is fastened by a sort
of button and loop which can be slipped by a turn of the wrist, thus
freeing one dog at a time. This is very necessary, because young dogs
often get the trace between their hind legs, where it cuts to the bone.
And they one and all WILL go visiting their friends as they run, jumping
in and out among the traces. Then they fight, and the result is more
mixed than a wet fishing-line next morning. A great deal of trouble can
be avoided by scientific use of the whip. Every Inuit boy prides himself
as being a master of the long lash; but it is easy to flick at a mark on
the ground, and difficult to lean forward and catch a shirking dog just
behind the shoulders when the sleigh is going at full speed. If you call
one dog’s name for “visiting,” and accidentally lash another, the two
will fight it out at once, and stop all the others. Again, if you travel
with a companion and begin to talk, or by yourself and sing, the dogs
will halt, turn round, and sit down to hear what you have to say. Kotuko
was run away from once or twice through forgetting to block the sleigh
when he stopped; and he broke many lashings, and ruined a few thongs
before he could be trusted with a full team of eight and the light
sleigh. Then he felt himself a person of consequence, and on smooth,
black ice, with a bold heart and a quick elbow, he smoked along over
the levels as fast as a pack in full cry. He would go ten miles to the
seal-holes, and when he was on the hunting-grounds he would twitch a
trace loose from the pitu, and free the big black leader, who was
the cleverest dog in the team. As soon as the dog had scented a
breathing-hole, Kotuko would reverse the sleigh, driving a couple of
sawed-off antlers, that stuck up like perambulator-handles from the
back-rest, deep into the snow, so that the team could not get away. Then
he would crawl forward inch by inch, and wait till the seal came up
to breathe. Then he would stab down swiftly with his spear and
running-line, and presently would haul his seal up to the lip of the
ice, while the black leader came up and helped to pull the carcass
across the ice to the sleigh. That was the time when the harnessed dogs
yelled and foamed with excitement, and Kotuko laid the long lash like a
red-hot bar across all their faces, till the carcass froze stiff. Going
home was the heavy work. The loaded sleigh had to be humoured among the
rough ice, and the dogs sat down and looked hungrily at the seal instead
of pulling. At last they would strike the well-worn sleigh-road to the
village, and toodle-kiyi along the ringing ice, heads down and tails
up, while Kotuko struck up the “An-gutivaun tai-na tau-na-ne taina” (The
Song of the Returning Hunter), and voices hailed him from house to house
under all that dim, star-littern sky.

When Kotuko the dog came to his full growth he enjoyed himself too. He
fought his way up the team steadily, fight after fight, till one fine
evening, over their food, he tackled the big, black leader (Kotuko the
boy saw fair play), and made second dog of him, as they say. So he was
promoted to the long thong of the leading dog, running five feet in
advance of all the others: it was his bounden duty to stop all fighting,
in harness or out of it, and he wore a collar of copper wire, very thick
and heavy. On special occasions he was fed with cooked food inside the
house, and sometimes was allowed to sleep on the bench with Kotuko. He
was a good seal-dog, and would keep a musk-ox at bay by running round
him and snapping at his heels. He would even--and this for a sleigh-dog
is the last proof of bravery--he would even stand up to the gaunt Arctic
wolf, whom all dogs of the North, as a rule, fear beyond anything
that walks the snow. He and his master--they did not count the team of
ordinary dogs as company--hunted together, day after day and night
after night, fur-wrapped boy and savage, long-haired, narrow-eyed,
white-fanged, yellow brute. All an Inuit has to do is to get food and
skins for himself and his family. The women-folk make the skins into
clothing, and occasionally help in trapping small game; but the bulk
of the food--and they eat enormously--must be found by the men. If the
supply fails there is no one up there to buy or beg or borrow from. The
people must die.

An Inuit does not think of these chances till he is forced to. Kadlu,
Kotuko, Amoraq, and the boy-baby who kicked about in Amoraq’s fur hood
and chewed pieces of blubber all day, were as happy together as any
family in the world. They came of a very gentle race--an Inuit seldom
loses his temper, and almost never strikes a child--who did not know
exactly what telling a real lie meant, still less how to steal. They
were content to spear their living out of the heart of the bitter,
hopeless cold; to smile oily smiles, and tell queer ghost and fairy
tales of evenings, and eat till they could eat no more, and sing the
endless woman’s song: “Amna aya, aya amna, ah! ah!” through the long
lamp-lighted days as they mended their clothes and their hunting-gear.

But one terrible winter everything betrayed them. The Tununirmiut
returned from the yearly salmon-fishing, and made their houses on the
early ice to the north of Bylot’s Island, ready to go after the seal
as soon as the sea froze. But it was an early and savage autumn. All
through September there were continuous gales that broke up the smooth
seal-ice when it was only four or five feet thick, and forced it inland,
and piled a great barrier, some twenty miles broad, of lumped and ragged
and needly ice, over which it was impossible to draw the dog-sleighs.
The edge of the floe off which the seal were used to fish in winter
lay perhaps twenty miles beyond this barrier, and out of reach of the
Tununirmiut. Even so, they might have managed to scrape through the
winter on their stock of frozen salmon and stored blubber, and what
the traps gave them, but in December one of their hunters came across a
tupik (a skin-tent) of three women and a girl nearly dead, whose men
had come down from the far North and been crushed in their little skin
hunting-boats while they were out after the long-horned narwhal. Kadlu,
of course, could only distribute the women among the huts of the winter
village, for no Inuit dare refuse a meal to a stranger. He never knows
when his own turn may come to beg. Amoraq took the girl, who was about
fourteen, into her own house as a sort of servant. From the cut of her
sharp-pointed hood, and the long diamond pattern of her white deer-skin
leggings, they supposed she came from Ellesmere Land. She had never seen
tin cooking-pots or wooden-shod sleighs before; but Kotuko the boy and
Kotuko the dog were rather fond of her.

Then all the foxes went south, and even the wolverine, that growling,
blunt-headed little thief of the snow, did not take the trouble to
follow the line of empty traps that Kotuko set. The tribe lost a
couple of their best hunters, who were badly crippled in a fight with
a musk-ox, and this threw more work on the others. Kotuko went out, day
after day, with a light hunting-sleigh and six or seven of the strongest
dogs, looking till his eyes ached for some patch of clear ice where
a seal might perhaps have scratched a breathing-hole. Kotuko the dog
ranged far and wide, and in the dead stillness of the ice-fields
Kotuko the boy could hear his half-choked whine of excitement, above a
seal-hole three miles away, as plainly as though he were at his elbow.
When the dog found a hole the boy would build himself a little, low snow
wall to keep off the worst of the bitter wind, and there he would wait
ten, twelve, twenty hours for the seal to come up to breathe, his eyes
glued to the tiny mark he had made above the hole to guide the downward
thrust of his harpoon, a little seal-skin mat under his feet, and his
legs tied together in the tutareang (the buckle that the old hunters
had talked about). This helps to keep a man’s legs from twitching as he
waits and waits and waits for the quick-eared seal to rise. Though there
is no excitement in it, you can easily believe that the sitting still in
the buckle with the thermometer perhaps forty degrees below zero is
the hardest work an Inuit knows. When a seal was caught, Kotuko the dog
would bound forward, his trace trailing behind him, and help to pull the
body to the sleigh, where the tired and hungry dogs lay sullenly under
the lee of the broken ice.

A seal did not go very far, for each mouth in the little village had a
right to be filled, and neither bone, hide, nor sinew was wasted. The
dogs’ meat was taken for human use, and Amoraq fed the team with pieces
of old summer skin-tents raked out from under the sleeping-bench, and
they howled and howled again, and waked to howl hungrily. One could
tell by the soap-stone lamps in the huts that famine was near. In good
seasons, when blubber was plentiful, the light in the boat-shaped lamps
would be two feet high--cheerful, oily, and yellow. Now it was a
bare six inches: Amoraq carefully pricked down the moss wick, when an
unwatched flame brightened for a moment, and the eyes of all the family
followed her hand. The horror of famine up there in the great cold is
not so much dying, as dying in the dark. All the Inuit dread the dark
that presses on them without a break for six months in each year; and
when the lamps are low in the houses the minds of people begin to be
shaken and confused.

But worse was to come.

The underfed dogs snapped and growled in the passages, glaring at the
cold stars, and snuffing into the bitter wind, night after night. When
they stopped howling the silence fell down again as solid and heavy as a
snowdrift against a door, and men could hear the beating of their blood
in the thin passages of the ear, and the thumping of their own hearts,
that sounded as loud as the noise of sorcerers’ drums beaten across
the snow. One night Kotuko the dog, who had been unusually sullen in
harness, leaped up and pushed his head against Kotuko’s knee. Kotuko
patted him, but the dog still pushed blindly forward, fawning. Then
Kadlu waked, and gripped the heavy wolf-like head, and stared into the
glassy eyes. The dog whimpered and shivered between Kadlu’s knees. The
hair rose about his neck, and he growled as though a stranger were at
the door; then he barked joyously, and rolled on the ground, and bit at
Kotuko’s boot like a puppy.

“What is it?” said Kotuko; for he was beginning to be afraid.

“The sickness,” Kadlu answered. “It is the dog sickness.” Kotuko the dog
lifted his nose and howled and howled again.

“I have not seen this before. What will he do?” said Kotuko.

Kadlu shrugged one shoulder a little, and crossed the hut for his short
stabbing-harpoon. The big dog looked at him, howled again, and slunk
away down the passage, while the other dogs drew aside right and left to
give him ample room. When he was out on the snow he barked furiously, as
though on the trail of a musk-ox, and, barking and leaping and frisking,
passed out of sight. His trouble was not hydrophobia, but simple, plain
madness. The cold and the hunger, and, above all, the dark, had turned
his head; and when the terrible dog-sickness once shows itself in a
team, it spreads like wild-fire. Next hunting-day another dog sickened,
and was killed then and there by Kotuko as he bit and struggled among
the traces. Then the black second dog, who had been the leader in the
old days, suddenly gave tongue on an imaginary reindeer-track, and when
they slipped him from the pitu he flew at the throat of an ice-cliff,
and ran away as his leader had done, his harness on his back. After that
no one would take the dogs out again. They needed them for something
else, and the dogs knew it; and though they were tied down and fed by
hand, their eyes were full of despair and fear. To make things worse,
the old women began to tell ghost-tales, and to say that they had met
the spirits of the dead hunters lost that autumn, who prophesied all
sorts of horrible things.

Kotuko grieved more for the loss of his dog than anything else; for
though an Inuit eats enormously he also knows how to starve. But the
hunger, the darkness, the cold, and the exposure told on his strength,
and he began to hear voices inside his head, and to see people who
were not there, out of the tail of his eye. One night--he had unbuckled
himself after ten hours’ waiting above a “blind” seal-hole, and was
staggering back to the village faint and dizzy--he halted to lean
his back against a boulder which happened to be supported like a
rocking-stone on a single jutting point of ice. His weight disturbed the
balance of the thing, it rolled over ponderously, and as Kotuko
sprang aside to avoid it, slid after him, squeaking and hissing on the
ice-slope.

That was enough for Kotuko. He had been brought up to believe that every
rock and boulder had its owner (its inua), who was generally a one-eyed
kind of a Woman-Thing called a tornaq, and that when a tornaq meant to
help a man she rolled after him inside her stone house, and asked him
whether he would take her for a guardian spirit. (In summer thaws the
ice-propped rocks and boulders roll and slip all over the face of the
land, so you can easily see how the idea of live stones arose.) Kotuko
heard the blood beating in his ears as he had heard it all day, and
he thought that was the tornaq of the stone speaking to him. Before he
reached home he was quite certain that he had held a long conversation
with her, and as all his people believed that this was quite possible,
no one contradicted him.

“She said to me, ‘I jump down, I jump down from my place on the snow,’”
 cried Kotuko, with hollow eyes, leaning forward in the half-lighted hut.
“She said, ‘I will be a guide.’ She said, ‘I will guide you to the good
seal-holes.’ To-morrow I go out, and the tornaq will guide me.”

Then the angekok, the village sorcerer, came in, and Kotuko told him the
tale a second time. It lost nothing in the telling.

“Follow the tornait [the spirits of the stones], and they will bring us
food again,” said the angekok.

Now the girl from the North had been lying near the lamp, eating very
little and saying less for days past; but when Amoraq and Kadlu next
morning packed and lashed a little hand-sleigh for Kotuko, and loaded it
with his hunting-gear and as much blubber and frozen seal-meat as they
could spare, she took the pulling-rope, and stepped out boldly at the
boy’s side.

“Your house is my house,” she said, as the little bone-shod sleigh
squeaked and bumped behind them in the awful Arctic night.

“My house is your house,” said Kotuko; “but I think that we shall both
go to Sedna together.”

Now Sedna is the Mistress of the Underworld, and the Inuit believe that
every one who dies must spend a year in her horrible country before
going to Quadliparmiut, the Happy Place, where it never freezes and the
fat reindeer trot up when you call.

Through the village people were shouting: “The tornait have spoken to
Kotuko. They will show him open ice. He will bring us the seal again!”
 Their voices were soon swallowed up by the cold, empty dark, and
Kotuko and the girl shouldered close together as they strained on the
pulling-rope or humoured the sleigh through the ice in the direction of
the Polar Sea. Kotuko insisted that the tornaq of the stone had told him
to go north, and north they went under Tuktuqdjung the Reindeer--those
stars that we call the Great Bear.

No European could have made five miles a day over the ice-rubbish and
the sharp-edged drifts; but those two knew exactly the turn of the wrist
that coaxes a sleigh round a hummock, the jerk that nearly lifts it
out of an ice-crack, and the exact strength that goes to the few quiet
strokes of the spear-head that make a path possible when everything
looks hopeless.

The girl said nothing, but bowed her head, and the long wolverine-fur
fringe of her ermine hood blew across her broad, dark face. The sky
above them was an intense velvety black, changing to bands of Indian
red on the horizon, where the great stars burned like street-lamps. From
time to time a greenish wave of the Northern Lights would roll across
the hollow of the high heavens, flick like a flag, and disappear; or
a meteor would crackle from darkness to darkness, trailing a shower of
sparks behind. Then they could see the ridged and furrowed surface of
the floe tipped and laced with strange colours--red, copper, and bluish;
but in the ordinary starlight everything turned to one frost-bitten
gray. The floe, as you will remember, had been battered and tormented by
the autumn gales till it was one frozen earthquake. There were gullies
and ravines, and holes like gravel-pits, cut in ice; lumps and scattered
pieces frozen down to the original floor of the floe; blotches of old
black ice that had been thrust under the floe in some gale and heaved
up again; roundish boulders of ice; saw-like edges of ice carved by the
snow that flies before the wind; and sunken pits where thirty or forty
acres lay below the level of the rest of the field. From a little
distance you might have taken the lumps for seal or walrus, overturned
sleighs or men on a hunting expedition, or even the great Ten-legged
White Spirit-Bear himself; but in spite of these fantastic shapes, all
on the very edge of starting into life, there was neither sound nor the
least faint echo of sound. And through this silence and through this
waste, where the sudden lights flapped and went out again, the sleigh
and the two that pulled it crawled like things in a nightmare--a
nightmare of the end of the world at the end of the world.

When they were tired Kotuko would make what the hunters call a
“half-house,” a very small snow hut, into which they would huddle with
the travelling-lamp, and try to thaw out the frozen seal-meat. When they
had slept, the march began again--thirty miles a day to get ten miles
northward. The girl was always very silent, but Kotuko muttered
to himself and broke out into songs he had learned in the
Singing-House--summer songs, and reindeer and salmon songs--all horribly
out of place at that season. He would declare that he heard the tornaq
growling to him, and would run wildly up a hummock, tossing his arms and
speaking in loud, threatening tones. To tell the truth, Kotuko was very
nearly crazy for the time being; but the girl was sure that he was being
guided by his guardian spirit, and that everything would come right.
She was not surprised, therefore, when at the end of the fourth march
Kotuko, whose eyes were burning like fire-balls in his head, told her
that his tornaq was following them across the snow in the shape of a
two-headed dog. The girl looked where Kotuko pointed, and something
seemed to slip into a ravine. It was certainly not human, but everybody
knew that the tornait preferred to appear in the shape of bear and seal,
and such like.

It might have been the Ten-legged White Spirit-Bear himself, or it might
have been anything, for Kotuko and the girl were so starved that their
eyes were untrustworthy. They had trapped nothing, and seen no trace of
game since they had left the village; their food would not hold out for
another week, and there was a gale coming. A Polar storm can blow for
ten days without a break, and all that while it is certain death to
be abroad. Kotuko laid up a snow-house large enough to take in the
hand-sleigh (never be separated from your meat), and while he was
shaping the last irregular block of ice that makes the key-stone of the
roof, he saw a Thing looking at him from a little cliff of ice half a
mile away. The air was hazy, and the Thing seemed to be forty feet long
and ten feet high, with twenty feet of tail and a shape that quivered
all along the outlines. The girl saw it too, but instead of crying aloud
with terror, said quietly, “That is Quiquern. What comes after?”

“He will speak to me,” said Kotuko; but the snow-knife trembled in his
hand as he spoke, because however much a man may believe that he is a
friend of strange and ugly spirits, he seldom likes to be taken quite
at his word. Quiquern, too, is the phantom of a gigantic toothless
dog without any hair, who is supposed to live in the far North, and to
wander about the country just before things are going to happen. They
may be pleasant or unpleasant things, but not even the sorcerers care to
speak about Quiquern. He makes the dogs go mad. Like the Spirit-Bear, he
has several extra pairs of legs,--six or eight,--and this Thing jumping
up and down in the haze had more legs than any real dog needed. Kotuko
and the girl huddled into their hut quickly. Of course if Quiquern had
wanted them, he could have torn it to pieces above their heads, but the
sense of a foot-thick snow-wall between themselves and the wicked dark
was great comfort. The gale broke with a shriek of wind like the shriek
of a train, and for three days and three nights it held, never varying
one point, and never lulling even for a minute. They fed the stone lamp
between their knees, and nibbled at the half-warm seal-meat, and watched
the black soot gather on the roof for seventy-two long hours. The girl
counted up the food in the sleigh; there was not more than two days’
supply, and Kotuko looked over the iron heads and the deer-sinew
fastenings of his harpoon and his seal-lance and his bird-dart. There
was nothing else to do.

“We shall go to Sedna soon--very soon,” the girl whispered. “In three
days we shall lie down and go. Will your tornaq do nothing? Sing her an
angekok’s song to make her come here.”

He began to sing in the high-pitched howl of the magic songs, and the
gale went down slowly. In the middle of his song the girl started, laid
her mittened hand and then her head to the ice floor of the hut. Kotuko
followed her example, and the two kneeled, staring into each other’s
eyes, and listening with every nerve. He ripped a thin sliver of
whalebone from the rim of a bird-snare that lay on the sleigh, and,
after straightening, set it upright in a little hole in the ice, firming
it down with his mitten. It was almost as delicately adjusted as a
compass-needle, and now instead of listening they watched. The thin rod
quivered a little--the least little jar in the world; then it vibrated
steadily for a few seconds, came to rest, and vibrated again, this time
nodding to another point of the compass.

“Too soon!” said Kotuko. “Some big floe has broken far away outside.”

The girl pointed at the rod, and shook her head. “It is the big
breaking,” she said. “Listen to the ground-ice. It knocks.”

When they kneeled this time they heard the most curious muffled grunts
and knockings, apparently under their feet. Sometimes it sounded as
though a blind puppy were squeaking above the lamp; then as if a stone
were being ground on hard ice; and again, like muffled blows on a drum;
but all dragged out and made small, as though they travelled through a
little horn a weary distance away.

“We shall not go to Sedna lying down,” said Kotuko. “It is the breaking.
The tornaq has cheated us. We shall die.”

All this may sound absurd enough, but the two were face to face with
a very real danger. The three days’ gale had driven the deep water of
Baffin’s Bay southerly, and piled it on to the edge of the far-reaching
land-ice that stretches from Bylot’s Island to the west. Also, the
strong current which sets east out of Lancaster Sound carried with it
mile upon mile of what they call pack-ice--rough ice that has not frozen
into fields; and this pack was bombarding the floe at the same time
that the swell and heave of the storm-worked sea was weakening and
undermining it. What Kotuko and the girl had been listening to were the
faint echoes of that fight thirty or forty miles away, and the little
tell-tale rod quivered to the shock of it.

Now, as the Inuit say, when the ice once wakes after its long winter
sleep, there is no knowing what may happen, for solid floe-ice changes
shape almost as quickly as a cloud. The gale was evidently a spring gale
sent out of time, and anything was possible.

Yet the two were happier in their minds than before. If the floe broke
up there would be no more waiting and suffering. Spirits, goblins, and
witch-people were moving about on the racking ice, and they might find
themselves stepping into Sedna’s country side by side with all sorts of
wild Things, the flush of excitement still on them. When they left the
hut after the gale, the noise on the horizon was steadily growing, and
the tough ice moaned and buzzed all round them.

“It is still waiting,” said Kotuko.

On the top of a hummock sat or crouched the eight-legged Thing that they
had seen three days before--and it howled horribly.

“Let us follow,” said the girl. “It may know some way that does not lead
to Sedna”; but she reeled from weakness as she took the pulling-rope.
The Thing moved off slowly and clumsily across the ridges, heading
always toward the westward and the land, and they followed, while the
growling thunder at the edge of the floe rolled nearer and nearer. The
floe’s lip was split and cracked in every direction for three or four
miles inland, and great pans of ten-foot-thick ice, from a few yards
to twenty acres square, were jolting and ducking and surging into one
another, and into the yet unbroken floe, as the heavy swell took and
shook and spouted between them. This battering-ram ice was, so to speak,
the first army that the sea was flinging against the floe. The incessant
crash and jar of these cakes almost drowned the ripping sound of sheets
of pack-ice driven bodily under the floe as cards are hastily pushed
under a tablecloth. Where the water was shallow these sheets would be
piled one atop of the other till the bottommost touched mud fifty feet
down, and the discoloured sea banked behind the muddy ice till the
increasing pressure drove all forward again. In addition to the floe and
the pack-ice, the gale and the currents were bringing down true bergs,
sailing mountains of ice, snapped off from the Greenland side of the
water or the north shore of Melville Bay. They pounded in solemnly,
the waves breaking white round them, and advanced on the floe like an
old-time fleet under full sail. A berg that seemed ready to carry the
world before it would ground helplessly in deep water, reel over, and
wallow in a lather of foam and mud and flying frozen spray, while a much
smaller and lower one would rip and ride into the flat floe, flinging
tons of ice on either side, and cutting a track half a mile long before
it was stopped. Some fell like swords, shearing a raw-edged canal;
and others splintered into a shower of blocks, weighing scores of tons
apiece, that whirled and skirted among the hummocks. Others, again, rose
up bodily out of the water when they shoaled, twisted as though in
pain, and fell solidly on their sides, while the sea threshed over their
shoulders. This trampling and crowding and bending and buckling and
arching of the ice into every possible shape was going on as far as the
eye could reach all along the north line of the floe. From where
Kotuko and the girl were, the confusion looked no more than an uneasy,
rippling, crawling movement under the horizon; but it came toward them
each moment, and they could hear, far away to landward a heavy booming,
as it might have been the boom of artillery through a fog. That showed
that the floe was being jammed home against the iron cliffs of Bylot’s
Island, the land to the southward behind them.

“This has never been before,” said Kotuko, staring stupidly. “This is
not the time. How can the floe break NOW?”

“Follow THAT!” the girl cried, pointing to the Thing half limping,
half running distractedly before them. They followed, tugging at the
hand-sleigh, while nearer and nearer came the roaring march of the ice.
At last the fields round them cracked and starred in every direction,
and the cracks opened and snapped like the teeth of wolves. But where
the Thing rested, on a mound of old and scattered ice-blocks some fifty
feet high, there was no motion. Kotuko leaped forward wildly, dragging
the girl after him, and crawled to the bottom of the mound. The talking
of the ice grew louder and louder round them, but the mound stayed fast,
and, as the girl looked at him, he threw his right elbow upward and
outward, making the Inuit sign for land in the shape of an island. And
land it was that the eight-legged, limping Thing had led them to--some
granite-tipped, sand-beached islet off the coast, shod and sheathed and
masked with ice so that no man could have told it from the floe, but at
the bottom solid earth, and not shifting ice! The smashing and rebound
of the floes as they grounded and splintered marked the borders of it,
and a friendly shoal ran out to the northward, and turned aside the rush
of the heaviest ice, exactly as a ploughshare turns over loam. There was
danger, of course, that some heavily squeezed ice-field might shoot up
the beach, and plane off the top of the islet bodily; but that did not
trouble Kotuko and the girl when they made their snow-house and began
to eat, and heard the ice hammer and skid along the beach. The Thing
had disappeared, and Kotuko was talking excitedly about his power over
spirits as he crouched round the lamp. In the middle of his wild sayings
the girl began to laugh, and rock herself backward and forward.

Behind her shoulder, crawling into the hut crawl by crawl, there were
two heads, one yellow and one black, that belonged to two of the most
sorrowful and ashamed dogs that ever you saw. Kotuko the dog was one,
and the black leader was the other. Both were now fat, well-looking, and
quite restored to their proper minds, but coupled to each other in an
extraordinary fashion. When the black leader ran off, you remember, his
harness was still on him. He must have met Kotuko the dog, and played or
fought with him, for his shoulder-loop had caught in the plaited copper
wire of Kotuko’s collar, and had drawn tight, so that neither could get
at the trace to gnaw it apart, but each was fastened sidelong to
his neighbour’s neck. That, with the freedom of hunting on their own
account, must have helped to cure their madness. They were very sober.

The girl pushed the two shamefaced creatures towards Kotuko, and,
sobbing with laughter, cried, “That is Quiquern, who led us to safe
ground. Look at his eight legs and double head!”

Kotuko cut them free, and they fell into his arms, yellow and black
together, trying to explain how they had got their senses back again.
Kotuko ran a hand down their ribs, which were round and well clothed.
“They have found food,” he said, with a grin. “I do not think we shall
go to Sedna so soon. My tornaq sent these. The sickness has left them.”

As soon as they had greeted Kotuko, these two, who had been forced to
sleep and eat and hunt together for the past few weeks, flew at each
other’s throat, and there was a beautiful battle in the snow-house.
“Empty dogs do not fight,” Kotuko said. “They have found the seal. Let
us sleep. We shall find food.”

When they waked there was open water on the north beach of the island,
and all the loosened ice had been driven landward. The first sound of
the surf is one of the most delightful that the Inuit can hear, for it
means that spring is on the road. Kotuko and the girl took hold of hands
and smiled, for the clear, full roar of the surge among the ice
reminded them of salmon and reindeer time and the smell of blossoming
ground-willows. Even as they looked, the sea began to skim over between
the floating cakes of ice, so intense was the cold; but on the horizon
there was a vast red glare, and that was the light of the sunken sun.
It was more like hearing him yawn in his sleep than seeing him rise, and
the glare lasted for only a few minutes, but it marked the turn of the
year. Nothing, they felt, could alter that.

Kotuko found the dogs fighting over a fresh-killed seal who was
following the fish that a gale always disturbs. He was the first of some
twenty or thirty seal that landed on the island in the course of the
day, and till the sea froze hard there were hundreds of keen black heads
rejoicing in the shallow free water and floating about with the floating
ice.

It was good to eat seal-liver again; to fill the lamps recklessly with
blubber, and watch the flame blaze three feet in the air; but as soon
as the new sea-ice bore, Kotuko and the girl loaded the hand-sleigh, and
made the two dogs pull as they had never pulled in their lives, for they
feared what might have happened in their village. The weather was as
pitiless as usual; but it is easier to draw a sleigh loaded with good
food than to hunt starving. They left five-and-twenty seal carcasses
buried in the ice of the beach, all ready for use, and hurried back to
their people. The dogs showed them the way as soon as Kotuko told them
what was expected, and though there was no sign of a landmark, in two
days they were giving tongue outside Kadlu’s house. Only three dogs
answered them; the others had been eaten, and the houses were all dark.
But when Kotuko shouted, “Ojo!” (boiled meat), weak voices replied, and
when he called the muster of the village name by name, very distinctly,
there were no gaps in it.

An hour later the lamps blazed in Kadlu’s house; snow-water was heating;
the pots were beginning to simmer, and the snow was dripping from the
roof, as Amoraq made ready a meal for all the village, and the boy-baby
in the hood chewed at a strip of rich nutty blubber, and the hunters
slowly and methodically filled themselves to the very brim with
seal-meat. Kotuko and the girl told their tale. The two dogs sat between
them, and whenever their names came in, they cocked an ear apiece and
looked most thoroughly ashamed of themselves. A dog who has once gone
mad and recovered, the Inuit say, is safe against all further attacks.

“So the tornaq did not forget us,” said Kotuko. “The storm blew, the ice
broke, and the seal swam in behind the fish that were frightened by the
storm. Now the new seal-holes are not two days distant. Let the good
hunters go to-morrow and bring back the seal I have speared--twenty-five
seal buried in the ice. When we have eaten those we will all follow the
seal on the floe.”

“What do YOU do?” said the sorcerer in the same sort of voice as he used
to Kadlu, richest of the Tununirmiut.

Kadlu looked at the girl from the North, and said quietly, “WE build a
house.” He pointed to the north-west side of Kadlu’s house, for that is
the side on which the married son or daughter always lives.

The girl turned her hands palm upward, with a little despairing shake
of her head. She was a foreigner, picked up starving, and could bring
nothing to the housekeeping.

Amoraq jumped from the bench where she sat, and began to sweep things
into the girl’s lap--stone lamps, iron skin-scrapers, tin kettles,
deer-skins embroidered with musk-ox teeth, and real canvas-needles such
as sailors use--the finest dowry that has ever been given on the far
edge of the Arctic Circle, and the girl from the North bowed her head
down to the very floor.

“Also these!” said Kotuko, laughing and signing to the dogs, who thrust
their cold muzzles into the girl’s face.

“Ah,” said the angekok, with an important cough, as though he had been
thinking it all over. “As soon as Kotuko left the village I went to the
Singing-House and sang magic. I sang all the long nights, and called
upon the Spirit of the Reindeer. MY singing made the gale blow that
broke the ice and drew the two dogs toward Kotuko when the ice would
have crushed his bones. MY song drew the seal in behind the broken ice.
My body lay still in the quaggi, but my spirit ran about on the ice, and
guided Kotuko and the dogs in all the things they did. I did it.”

Everybody was full and sleepy, so no one contradicted; and the angekok,
by virtue of his office, helped himself to yet another lump of boiled
meat, and lay down to sleep with the others in the warm, well-lighted,
oil-smelling home.

*****

Now Kotuko, who drew very well in the Inuit fashion, scratched pictures
of all these adventures on a long, flat piece of ivory with a hole at
one end. When he and the girl went north to Ellesmere Land in the year
of the Wonderful Open Winter, he left the picture-story with Kadlu, who
lost it in the shingle when his dog-sleigh broke down one summer on the
beach of Lake Netilling at Nikosiring, and there a Lake Inuit found
it next spring and sold it to a man at Imigen who was interpreter on a
Cumberland Sound whaler, and he sold it to Hans Olsen, who was afterward
a quartermaster on board a big steamer that took tourists to the North
Cape in Norway. When the tourist season was over, the steamer ran
between London and Australia, stopping at Ceylon, and there Olsen sold
the ivory to a Cingalese jeweller for two imitation sapphires. I found
it under some rubbish in a house at Colombo, and have translated it from
one end to the other.




‘ANGUTIVAUN TAINA’

[This is a very free translation of the Song of the Returning Hunter,
as the men used to sing it after seal-spearing. The Inuit always repeat
things over and over again.]

      Our gloves are stiff with the frozen blood,
        Our furs with the drifted snow,
      As we come in with the seal--the seal!
        In from the edge of the floe.

      Au jana! Aua! Oha! Haq!
        And the yelping dog-teams go,
      And the long whips crack, and the men come back,
        Back from the edge of the floe!

      We tracked our seal to his secret place,
        We heard him scratch below,
      We made our mark, and we watched beside,
        Out on the edge of the floe.

      We raised our lance when he rose to breathe,
        We drove it downward--so!
      And we played him thus, and we killed him thus,
        Out on the edge of the floe.

      Our gloves are glued with the frozen blood,
        Our eyes with the drifting snow;
      But we come back to our wives again,
        Back from the edge of the floe!

      Au jana! Aua! Oha! Haq!
        And the loaded dog-teams go,
      And the wives can hear their men come back.
        Back from the edge of the floe!




RED DOG

     For our white and our excellent nights---for the nights of
           swift running.
         Fair ranging, far seeing, good hunting, sure cunning!
     For the smells of the dawning, untainted, ere dew has departed!
     For the rush through the mist, and the quarry blind-started!
     For the cry of our mates when the sambhur has wheeled and is
           standing at bay,
               For the risk and the riot of night!
               For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day,
               It is met, and we go to the fight.
                                 Bay! O Bay!

It was after the letting in of the Jungle that the pleasantest part of
Mowgli’s life began. He had the good conscience that comes from paying
debts; all the Jungle was his friend, and just a little afraid of him.
The things that he did and saw and heard when he was wandering from one
people to another, with or without his four companions, would make many
many stories, each as long as this one. So you will never be told how
he met the Mad Elephant of Mandla, who killed two-and-twenty bullocks
drawing eleven carts of coined silver to the Government Treasury,
and scattered the shiny rupees in the dust; how he fought Jacala, the
Crocodile, all one long night in the Marshes of the North, and broke his
skinning-knife on the brute’s back-plates; how he found a new and longer
knife round the neck of a man who had been killed by a wild boar, and
how he tracked that boar and killed him as a fair price for the knife;
how he was caught up once in the Great Famine, by the moving of the
deer, and nearly crushed to death in the swaying hot herds; how he saved
Hathi the Silent from being once more trapped in a pit with a stake
at the bottom, and how, next day, he himself fell into a very cunning
leopard-trap, and how Hathi broke the thick wooden bars to pieces above
him; how he milked the wild buffaloes in the swamp, and how----

But we must tell one tale at a time. Father and Mother Wolf died, and
Mowgli rolled a big boulder against the mouth of their cave, and cried
the Death Song over them; Baloo grew very old and stiff, and even
Bagheera, whose nerves were steel and whose muscles were iron, was a
shade slower on the kill than he had been. Akela turned from gray to
milky white with pure age; his ribs stuck out, and he walked as though
he had been made of wood, and Mowgli killed for him. But the young
wolves, the children of the disbanded Seeonee Pack, throve and
increased, and when there were about forty of them, masterless,
full-voiced, clean-footed five-year-olds, Akela told them that they
ought to gather themselves together and follow the Law, and run under
one head, as befitted the Free People.

This was not a question in which Mowgli concerned himself, for, as he
said, he had eaten sour fruit, and he knew the tree it hung from; but
when Phao, son of Phaona (his father was the Gray Tracker in the days
of Akela’s headship), fought his way to the leadership of the Pack,
according to the Jungle Law, and the old calls and songs began to ring
under the stars once more, Mowgli came to the Council Rock for memory’s
sake. When he chose to speak the Pack waited till he had finished, and
he sat at Akela’s side on the rock above Phao. Those were days of good
hunting and good sleeping. No stranger cared to break into the jungles
that belonged to Mowgli’s people, as they called the Pack, and the young
wolves grew fat and strong, and there were many cubs to bring to the
Looking-over. Mowgli always attended a Looking-over, remembering the
night when a black panther bought a naked brown baby into the pack,
and the long call, “Look, look well, O Wolves,” made his heart flutter.
Otherwise, he would be far away in the Jungle with his four brothers,
tasting, touching, seeing, and feeling new things.

One twilight when he was trotting leisurely across the ranges to give
Akela the half of a buck that he had killed, while the Four jogged
behind him, sparring a little, and tumbling one another over for joy of
being alive, he heard a cry that had never been heard since the bad days
of Shere Khan. It was what they call in the Jungle the pheeal, a hideous
kind of shriek that the jackal gives when he is hunting behind a tiger,
or when there is a big killing afoot. If you can imagine a mixture of
hate, triumph, fear, and despair, with a kind of leer running through
it, you will get some notion of the pheeal that rose and sank and
wavered and quavered far away across the Waingunga. The Four stopped at
once, bristling and growling. Mowgli’s hand went to his knife, and he
checked, the blood in his face, his eyebrows knotted.

“There is no Striped One dare kill here,” he said.

“That is not the cry of the Forerunner,” answered Gray Brother. “It is
some great killing. Listen!”

It broke out again, half sobbing and half chuckling, just as though the
jackal had soft human lips. Then Mowgli drew deep breath, and ran to the
Council Rock, overtaking on his way hurrying wolves of the Pack.
Phao and Akela were on the Rock together, and below them, every nerve
strained, sat the others. The mothers and the cubs were cantering off to
their lairs; for when the pheeal cries it is no time for weak things to
be abroad.

They could hear nothing except the Waingunga rushing and gurgling in
the dark, and the light evening winds among the tree-tops, till suddenly
across the river a wolf called. It was no wolf of the Pack, for they
were all at the Rock. The note changed to a long, despairing bay; and
“Dhole!” it said, “Dhole! dhole! dhole!” They heard tired feet on the
rocks, and a gaunt wolf, streaked with red on his flanks, his right
fore-paw useless, and his jaws white with foam, flung himself into the
circle and lay gasping at Mowgli’s feet.

“Good hunting! Under whose Headship?” said Phao gravely.

“Good hunting! Won-tolla am I,” was the answer. He meant that he was
a solitary wolf, fending for himself, his mate, and his cubs in
some lonely lair, as do many wolves in the south. Won-tolla means an
Outlier--one who lies out from any Pack. Then he panted, and they could
see his heart-beats shake him backward and forward.

“What moves?” said Phao, for that is the question all the Jungle asks
after the pheeal cries.

“The dhole, the dhole of the Dekkan--Red Dog, the Killer! They came
north from the south saying the Dekkan was empty and killing out by the
way. When this moon was new there were four to me--my mate and three
cubs. She would teach them to kill on the grass plains, hiding to
drive the buck, as we do who are of the open. At midnight I heard them
together, full tongue on the trail. At the dawn-wind I found them stiff
in the grass--four, Free People, four when this moon was new. Then
sought I my Blood-Right and found the dhole.”

“How many?” said Mowgli quickly; the Pack growled deep in their throats.

“I do not know. Three of them will kill no more, but at the last they
drove me like the buck; on my three legs they drove me. Look, Free
People!”

He thrust out his mangled fore-foot, all dark with dried blood. There
were cruel bites low down on his side, and his throat was torn and
worried.

“Eat,” said Akela, rising up from the meat Mowgli had brought him, and
the Outlier flung himself on it.

“This shall be no loss,” he said humbly, when he had taken off the first
edge of his hunger. “Give me a little strength, Free People, and I also
will kill. My lair is empty that was full when this moon was new, and
the Blood Debt is not all paid.”

Phao heard his teeth crack on a haunch-bone and grunted approvingly.

“We shall need those jaws,” said he. “Were there cubs with the dhole?”

“Nay, nay. Red Hunters all: grown dogs of their Pack, heavy and strong
for all that they eat lizards in the Dekkan.”

What Won-tolla had said meant that the dhole, the red hunting-dog of the
Dekkan, was moving to kill, and the Pack knew well that even the tiger
will surrender a new kill to the dhole. They drive straight through the
Jungle, and what they meet they pull down and tear to pieces. Though
they are not as big nor half as cunning as the wolf, they are very
strong and very numerous. The dhole, for instance, do not begin to call
themselves a pack till they are a hundred strong; whereas forty wolves
make a very fair pack indeed. Mowgli’s wanderings had taken him to
the edge of the high grassy downs of the Dekkan, and he had seen the
fearless dholes sleeping and playing and scratching themselves in the
little hollows and tussocks that they use for lairs. He despised and
hated them because they did not smell like the Free People, because they
did not live in caves, and, above all, because they had hair between
their toes while he and his friends were clean-footed. But he knew, for
Hathi had told him, what a terrible thing a dhole hunting-pack was. Even
Hathi moves aside from their line, and until they are killed, or till
game is scarce, they will go forward.

Akela knew something of the dholes, too, for he said to Mowgli quietly,
“It is better to die in a Full Pack than leaderless and alone. This is
good hunting, and--my last. But, as men live, thou hast very many more
nights and days, Little Brother. Go north and lie down, and if any live
after the dhole has gone by he shall bring thee word of the fight.”


“Ah,” said Mowgli, quite gravely, “must I go to the marshes and catch
little fish and sleep in a tree, or must I ask help of the Bandar-log
and crack nuts, while the Pack fight below?”

“It is to the death,” said Akela. “Thou hast never met the dhole--the
Red Killer. Even the Striped One----”

“Aowa! Aowa!” said Mowgli pettingly. “I have killed one striped ape, and
sure am I in my stomach that Shere Khan would have left his own mate for
meat to the dhole if he had winded a pack across three ranges. Listen
now: There was a wolf, my father, and there was a wolf, my mother, and
there was an old gray wolf (not too wise: he is white now) was my father
and my mother. Therefore I--” he raised his voice, “I say that when the
dhole come, and if the dhole come, Mowgli and the Free People are of
one skin for that hunting; and I say, by the Bull that bought me--by the
Bull Bagheera paid for me in the old days which ye of the Pack do not
remember--_I_ say, that the Trees and the River may hear and hold fast
if I forget; _I_ say that this my knife shall be as a tooth to the
Pack--and I do not think it is so blunt. This is my Word which has gone
from me.”

“Thou dost not know the dhole, man with a wolf’s tongue,” said
Won-tolla. “I look only to clear the Blood Debt against them ere they
have me in many pieces. They move slowly, killing out as they go, but in
two days a little strength will come back to me and I turn again for the
Blood Debt. But for YE, Free People, my word is that ye go north and eat
but little for a while till the dhole are gone. There is no meat in this
hunting.”

“Hear the Outlier!” said Mowgli with a laugh. “Free People, we must go
north and dig lizards and rats from the bank, lest by any chance we meet
the dhole. He must kill out our hunting-grounds, while we lie hid in the
north till it please him to give us our own again. He is a dog--and the
pup of a dog--red, yellow-bellied, lairless, and haired between every
toe! He counts his cubs six and eight at the litter, as though he were
Chikai, the little leaping rat. Surely we must run away, Free People,
and beg leave of the peoples of the north for the offal of dead cattle!
Ye know the saying: ‘North are the vermin; south are the lice. WE are
the Jungle.’ Choose ye, O choose. It is good hunting! For the Pack--for
the Full Pack--for the lair and the litter; for the in-kill and the
out-kill; for the mate that drives the doe and the little, little cub
within the cave; it is met!--it is met!--it is met!”

The Pack answered with one deep, crashing bark that sounded in the night
like a big tree falling. “It is met!” they cried. “Stay with these,”
 said Mowgli to the Four. “We shall need every tooth. Phao and Akela must
make ready the battle. I go to count the dogs.”

“It is death!” Won-tolla cried, half rising. “What can such a hairless
one do against the Red Dog? Even the Striped One, remember----”

“Thou art indeed an Outlier,” Mowgli called back; “but we will speak
when the dholes are dead. Good hunting all!”

He hurried off into the darkness, wild with excitement, hardly looking
where he set foot, and the natural consequence was that he tripped full
length over Kaa’s great coils where the python lay watching a deer-path
near the river.

“Kssha!” said Kaa angrily. “Is this jungle-work, to stamp and tramp and
undo a night’s hunting--when the game are moving so well, too?”

“The fault was mine,” said Mowgli, picking himself up. “Indeed I was
seeking thee, Flathead, but each time we meet thou art longer and
broader by the length of my arm. There is none like thee in the Jungle,
wise, old, strong, and most beautiful Kaa.”

“Now whither does THIS trail lead?” Kaa’s voice was gentler. “Not a
moon since there was a Manling with a knife threw stones at my head and
called me bad little tree-cat names, because I lay asleep in the open.”

“Ay, and turned every driven deer to all the winds, and Mowgli was
hunting, and this same Flathead was too deaf to hear his whistle, and
leave the deer-roads free,” Mowgli answered composedly, sitting down
among the painted coils.

“Now this same Manling comes with soft, tickling words to this same
Flathead, telling him that he is wise and strong and beautiful, and
this same old Flathead believes and makes a place, thus, for this same
stone-throwing Manling, and--Art thou at ease now? Could Bagheera give
thee so good a resting-place?”

Kaa had, as usual, made a sort of soft half-hammock of himself under
Mowgli’s weight. The boy reached out in the darkness, and gathered in
the supple cable-like neck till Kaa’s head rested on his shoulder, and
then he told him all that had happened in the Jungle that night.

“Wise I may be,” said Kaa at the end; “but deaf I surely am. Else I
should have heard the pheeal. Small wonder the Eaters of Grass are
uneasy. How many be the dhole?”

“I have not yet seen. I came hot-foot to thee. Thou art older than
Hathi. But oh, Kaa,”--here Mowgli wriggled with sheerjoy,--“it will be
good hunting. Few of us will see another moon.”

“Dost THOU strike in this? Remember thou art a Man; and remember what
Pack cast thee out. Let the Wolf look to the Dog. THOU art a Man.”

“Last year’s nuts are this year’s black earth,” said Mowgli. “It is true
that I am a Man, but it is in my stomach that this night I have said
that I am a Wolf. I called the River and the Trees to remember. I am of
the Free People, Kaa, till the dhole has gone by.”

“Free People,” Kaa grunted. “Free thieves! And thou hast tied thyself
into the death-knot for the sake of the memory of the dead wolves? This
is no good hunting.”

“It is my Word which I have spoken. The Trees know, the River knows.
Till the dhole have gone by my Word comes not back to me.”

“Ngssh! This changes all trails. I had thought to take thee away with me
to the northern marshes, but the Word--even the Word of a little, naked,
hairless Manling--is the Word. Now I, Kaa, say----”

“Think well, Flathead, lest thou tie thyself into the death-knot also. I
need no Word from thee, for well I know----”

“Be it so, then,” said Kaa. “I will give no Word; but what is in thy
stomach to do when the dhole come?”

“They must swim the Waingunga. I thought to meet them with my knife in
the shallows, the Pack behind me; and so stabbing and thrusting, we a
little might turn them down-stream, or cool their throats.”

“The dhole do not turn and their throats are hot,” said Kaa. “There will
be neither Manling nor Wolf-cub when that hunting is done, but only dry
bones.”

“Alala! If we die, we die. It will be most good hunting. But my stomach
is young, and I have not seen many Rains. I am not wise nor strong. Hast
thou a better plan, Kaa?”

“I have seen a hundred and a hundred Rains. Ere Hathi cast his
milk-tushes my trail was big in the dust. By the First Egg, I am older
than many trees, and I have seen all that the Jungle has done.”

“But THIS is new hunting,” said Mowgli. “Never before have the dhole
crossed our trail.”

“What is has been. What will be is no more than a forgotten year
striking backward. Be still while I count those my years.”

For a long hour Mowgli lay back among the coils, while Kaa, his head
motionless on the ground, thought of all that he had seen and known
since the day he came from the egg. The light seemed to go out of his
eyes and leave them like stale opals, and now and again he made little
stiff passes with his head, right and left, as though he were hunting in
his sleep. Mowgli dozed quietly, for he knew that there is nothing like
sleep before hunting, and he was trained to take it at any hour of the
day or night.

Then he felt Kaa’s back grow bigger and broader below him as the huge
python puffed himself out, hissing with the noise of a sword drawn from
a steel scabbard.

“I have seen all the dead seasons,” Kaa said at last, “and the
great trees and the old elephants, and the rocks that were bare and
sharp-pointed ere the moss grew. Art THOU still alive, Manling?”

“It is only a little after moonset,” said Mowgli. “I do not
understand----”

“Hssh! I am again Kaa. I knew it was but a little time. Now we will
go to the river, and I will show thee what is to be done against the
dhole.”

He turned, straight as an arrow, for the main stream of the Waingunga,
plunging in a little above the pool that hid the Peace Rock, Mowgli at
his side.

“Nay, do not swim. I go swiftly. My back, Little Brother.”

Mowgli tucked his left arm round Kaa’s neck, dropped his right close to
his body, and straightened his feet. Then Kaa breasted the current as
he alone could, and the ripple of the checked water stood up in a frill
round Mowgli’s neck, and his feet were waved to and fro in the eddy
under the python’s lashing sides. A mile or two above the Peace Rock
the Waingunga narrows between a gorge of marble rocks from eighty to
a hundred feet high, and the current runs like a mill-race between and
over all manner of ugly stones. But Mowgli did not trouble his head
about the water; little water in the world could have given him a
moment’s fear. He was looking at the gorge on either side and sniffing
uneasily, for there was a sweetish-sourish smell in the air, very like
the smell of a big ant-hill on a hot day. Instinctively he lowered
himself in the water, only raising his head to breathe from time to
time, and Kaa came to anchor with a double twist of his tail round a
sunken rock, holding Mowgli in the hollow of a coil, while the water
raced on.

“This is the Place of Death,” said the boy. “Why do we come here?”

“They sleep,” said Kaa. “Hathi will not turn aside for the Striped One.
Yet Hathi and the Striped One together turn aside for the dhole, and the
dhole they say turn aside for nothing. And yet for whom do the Little
People of the Rocks turn aside? Tell me, Master of the Jungle, who is
the Master of the Jungle?”

“These,” Mowgli whispered. “It is the Place of Death. Let us go.”

“Nay, look well, for they are asleep. It is as it was when I was not the
length of thy arm.”

The split and weatherworn rocks of the gorge of the Waingunga had been
used since the beginning of the Jungle by the Little People of the
Rocks--the busy, furious, black wild bees of India; and, as Mowgli knew
well, all trails turned off half a mile before they reached the gorge.
For centuries the Little People had hived and swarmed from cleft to
cleft, and swarmed again, staining the white marble with stale honey,
and made their combs tall and deep in the dark of the inner caves, where
neither man nor beast nor fire nor water had ever touched them. The
length of the gorge on both siaes was hung as it were with black
shimmery velvet curtains, and Mowgli sank as he looked, for those were
the clotted millions of the sleeping bees. There were other lumps and
festoons and things like decayed tree-trunks studded on the face of the
rock, the old combs of past years, or new cities built in the shadow of
the windless gorge, and huge masses of spongy, rotten trash had rolled
down and stuck among the trees and creepers that clung to the rock-face.
As he listened he heard more than once the rustle and slide of a
honey-loaded comb turning over or failing away somewhere in the dark
galleries; then a booming of angry wings, and the sullen drip, drip,
drip, of the wasted honey, guttering along till it lipped over some
ledge in the open air and sluggishly trickled down on the twigs. There
was a tiny little beach, not five feet broad, on one side of the river,
and that was piled high with the rubbish of uncounted years. There were
dead bees, drones, sweepings, and stale combs, and wings of marauding
moths that had strayed in after honey, all tumbled in smooth piles of
the finest black dust. The mere sharp smell of it was enough to frighten
anything that had no wings, and knew what the Little People were.

Kaa moved up-stream again till he came to a sandy bar at the head of the
gorge.

“Here is this season’s kill,” said he. “Look!” On the bank lay the
skeletons of a couple of young deer and a buffalo. Mowgli could see
that neither wolf nor jackal had touched the hones, which were laid out
naturally.

“They came beyond the line; they did not know the Law,” murmured
Mowgli, “and the Little People killed them. Let us go ere they wake.”

“They do not wake till the dawn,” said Kaa. “Now I will tell thee. A
hunted buck from the south, many, many Rains ago, came hither from the
south, not knowing the Jungle, a Pack on his trail. Being made blind by
fear, he leaped from above, the Pack running by sight, for they were
hot and blind on the trail. The sun was high, and the Little People were
many and very angry. Many, too, were those of the Pack who leaped into
the Waingunga, but they were dead ere they took water. Those who did not
leap died also in the rocks above. But the buck lived.”

“How?”

“Because he came first, running for his life, leaping ere the Little
People were aware, and was in the river when they gathered to kill.
The Pack, following, was altogether lost under the weight of the Little
People.”

“The buck lived?” Mowgli repeated slowly.

“At least he did not die THEN, though none waited his coming down with
a strong body to hold him safe against the water, as a certain old fat,
deaf, yellow Flathead would wait for a Manling--yea, though there were
all the dholes of the Dekkan on his trail. What is in thy stomach?”
 Kaa’s head was close to Mowgli’s ear; and it was a little time before
the boy answered.

“It is to pull the very whiskers of Death, but--Kaa, thou art, indeed,
the wisest of all the Jungle.”

“So many have said. Look now, if the dhole follow thee----”

“As surely they will follow. Ho! ho! I have many little thorns under my
tongue to prick into their hides.”

“If they follow thee hot and blind, looking only at thy shoulders, those
who do not die up above will take water either here or lower down, for
the Little People will rise up and cover them. Now the Waingunga is
hungry water, and they will have no Kaa to hold them, but will go down,
such as live, to the shallows by the Seeonee Lairs, and there thy Pack
may meet them by the throat.”

“Ahai! Eowawa! Better could not be till the Rains fall in the dry
season. There is now only the little matter of the run and the leap.
I will make me known to the dholes, so that they shall follow me very
closely.”

“Hast thou seen the rocks above thee? From the landward side?”

“Indeed, no. That I had forgotten.”

“Go look. It is all rotten ground, cut and full of holes. One of thy
clumsy feet set down without seeing would end the hunt. See, I leave
thee here, and for thy sake only I will carry word to the Pack that they
may know where to look for the dhole. For myself, I am not of one skin
with ANY wolf.”

When Kaa disliked an acquaintance he could be more unpleasant than any
of the Jungle People, except perhaps Bagheera. He swam down-stream,
and opposite the Rock he came on Phao and Akela listening to the night
noises.

“Hssh! Dogs,” he said cheerfully. “The dholes will come down-stream. If
ye be not afraid ye can kill them in the shallows.”

“When come they?” said Phao. “And where is my Man-cub?” said Akela.

“They come when they come,” said Kaa. “Wait and see. As for THY Man-cub,
from whom thou hast taken a Word and so laid him open to Death, THY
Man-cub is with ME, and if he be not already dead the fault is none
of thine, bleached dog! Wait here for the dhole, and be glad that the
Man-cub and I strike on thy side.”

Kaa flashed up-stream again, and moored himself in the middle of
the gorge, looking upward at the line of the cliff. Presently he saw
Mowgli’s head move against the stars, and then there was a whizz in
the air, the keen, clean schloop of a body falling feet first, and next
minute the boy was at rest again in the loop of Kaa’s body.

“It is no leap by night,” said Mowgli quietly. “I have jumped twice as
far for sport; but that is an evil place above--low bushes and gullies
that go down very deep, all full of the Little People. I have put big
stones one above the other by the side of three gullies. These I shall
throw down with my feet in running, and the Little People will rise up
behind me, very angry.”

“That is Man’s talk and Man’s cunning,” said Kaa. “Thou art wise, but
the Little People are always angry.”

“Nay, at twilight all wings near and far rest for a while. I will play
with the dhole at twilight, for the dhole hunts best by day. He follows
now Won-tolla’s blood-trail.”

“Chil does not leave a dead ox, nor the dhole the blood-trail,” said
Kaa.

“Then I will make him a new blood-trail, of his own blood, if I can, and
give him dirt to eat. Thou wilt stay here, Kaa, till I come again with
my dholes?”

“Ay, but what if they kill thee in the Jungle, or the Little People kill
thee before thou canst leap down to the river?”

“When to-morrow comes we will kill for to-morrow,” said Mowgli, quoting
a Jungle saying; and again, “When I am dead it is time to sing the Death
Song. Good hunting, Kaa!”

He loosed his arm from the python’s neck and went down the gorge like
a log in a freshet, paddling toward the far bank, where he found
slack-water, and laughing aloud from sheer happiness. There was nothing
Mowgli liked better than, as he himself said, “to pull the whiskers
of Death,” and make the Jungle know that he was their overlord. He had
often, with Baloo’s help, robbed bees’ nests in single trees, and
he knew that the Little People hated the smell of wild garlic. So he
gathered a small bundle of it, tied it up with a bark string, and then
followed Won-tolla’s blood-trail, as it ran southerly from the Lairs,
for some five miles, looking at the trees with his head on one side, and
chuckling as he looked.

“Mowgli the Frog have I been,” said he to himself; “Mowgli the Wolf have
I said that I am. Now Mowgli the Ape must I be before I am Mowgli the
Buck. At the end I shall be Mowgli the Man. Ho!” and he slid his thumb
along the eighteen-inch blade of his knife.

Won-tolla’s trail, all rank with dark blood-spots, ran under a forest of
thick trees that grew close together and stretched away north-eastward,
gradually growing thinner and thinner to within two miles of the Bee
Rocks. From the last tree to the low scrub of the Bee Rocks was open
country, where there was hardly cover enough to hide a wolf. Mowgli
trotted along under the trees, judging distances between branch and
branch, occasionally climbing up a trunk and taking a trial leap from
one tree to another till he came to the open ground, which he studied
very carefully for an hour. Then he turned, picked up Won-tolla’s trail
where he had left it, settled himself in a tree with an outrunning
branch some eight feet from the ground, and sat still, sharpening his
knife on the sole of his foot and singing to himself.

A little before mid-day, when the sun was very warm, he heard the patter
of feet and smelt the abominable smell of the dhole-pack as they trotted
pitilessly along Won-tolla’s trail. Seen from above, the red dhole does
not look half the size of a wolf, but Mowgli knew how strong his feet
and jaws were. He watched the sharp bay head of the leader snuffing
along the trail, and gave him “Good hunting!”

The brute looked up, and his companions halted behind him, scores and
scores of red dogs with low-hung tails, heavy shoulders, weak quarters,
and bloody mouths. The dholes are a very silent people as a rule, and
they have no manners even in their own Jungle. Fully two hundred must
have gathered below him, but he could see that the leaders sniffed
hungrily on Won-tolla’s trail, and tried to drag the Pack forward. That
would never do, or they would be at the Lairs in broad daylight, and
Mowgli meant to hold them under his tree till dusk.

“By whose leave do ye come here?” said Mowgli.

“All Jungles are our Jungle,” was the reply, and the dhole that gave
it bared his white teeth. Mowgli looked down with a smile, and imitated
perfectly the sharp chitter-chatter of Chikai, the leaping rat of the
Dekkan, meaning the dholes to understand that he considered them no
better than Chikai. The Pack closed up round the tree-trunk and the
leader bayed savagely, calling Mowgli a tree-ape. For an answer Mowgli
stretched down one naked leg and wriggled his bare toes just above the
leader’s head. That was enough, and more than enough, to wake the Pack
to stupid rage. Those who have hair between their toes do not care to be
reminded of it. Mowgli caught his foot away as the leader leaped up, and
said sweetly: “Dog, red dog! Go back to the Dekkan and eat lizards. Go to
Chikai thy brother--dog, dog--red, red dog! There is hair between every
toe!” He twiddled his toes a second time.

“Come down ere we starve thee out, hairless ape!” yelled the Pack, and
this was exactly what Mowgli wanted. He laid himself down along the
branch, his cheek to the bark, his right arm free, and there he told the
Pack what he thought and knew about them, their manners, their customs,
their mates, and their puppies. There is no speech in the world so
rancorous and so stinging as the language the Jungle People use to show
scorn and contempt. When you come to think of it you will see how this
must be so. As Mowgli told Kaa, he had many little thorns under his
tongue, and slowly and deliberately he drove the dholes from silence to
growls, from growls to yells, and from yells to hoarse slavery ravings.
They tried to answer his taunts, but a cub might as well have tried to
answer Kaa in a rage; and all the while Mowgli’s right hand lay crooked
at his side, ready for action, his feet locked round the branch. The big
bay leader had leaped many times in the air, but Mowgli dared not risk
a false blow. At last, made furious beyond his natural strength, he
bounded up seven or eight feet clear of the ground. Then Mowgli’s hand
shot out like the head of a tree-snake, and gripped him by the scruff
of his neck, and the branch shook with the jar as his weight fell back,
almost wrenching Mowgli to the ground. But he never loosed his grip, and
inch by inch he hauled the beast, hanging like a drowned jackal, up on
the branch. With his left hand he reached for his knife and cut off the
red, bushy tail, flinging the dhole back to earth again. That was all he
needed. The Pack would not go forward on Won-tolla’s trail now till they
had killed Mowgli or Mowgli had killed them. He saw them settle down
in circles with a quiver of the haunches that meant they were going
to stay, and so he climbed to a higher crotch, settled his back
comfortably, and went to sleep.

After three or four hours he waked and counted the Pack. They were all
there, silent, husky, and dry, with eyes of steel. The sun was beginning
to sink. In half an hour the Little People of the Rocks would be ending
their labours, and, as you know, the dhole does not fight best in the
twilight.

“I did not need such faithful watchers,” he said politely, standing up
on a branch, “but I will remember this. Ye be true dholes, but to my
thinking over much of one kind. For that reason I do not give the big
lizard-eater his tail again. Art thou not pleased, Red Dog?”

“I myself will tear out thy stomach!” yelled the leader, scratching at
the foot of the tree.

“Nay, but consider, wise rat of the Dekkan. There will now be many
litters of little tailless red dogs, yea, with raw red stumps that sting
when the sand is hot. Go home, Red Dog, and cry that an ape has done
this. Ye will not go? Come, then, with me, and I will make you very
wise!”

He moved, Bandar-log fashion, into the next tree, and so on into the
next and the next, the Pack following with lifted hungry heads. Now and
then he would pretend to fall, and the Pack would tumble one over the
other in their haste to be at the death. It was a curious sight--the boy
with the knife that shone in the low sunlight as it sifted through the
upper branches, and the silent Pack with their red coats all aflame,
huddling and following below. When he came to the last tree he took the
garlic and rubbed himself all over carefully, and the dholes yelled with
scorn. “Ape with a wolf’s tongue, dost thou think to cover thy scent?”
 they said. “We follow to the death.”

“Take thy tail,” said Mowgli, flinging it back along the course he had
taken. The Pack instinctively rushed after it. “And follow now--to the
death.”

He had slipped down the tree-trunk, and headed like the wind in bare
feet for the Bee Rocks, before the dholes saw what he would do.

They gave one deep howl, and settled down to the long, lobbing canter
that can at the last run down anything that runs. Mowgli knew their
pack-pace to be much slower than that of the wolves, or he would never
have risked a two-mile run in full sight. They were sure that the boy
was theirs at last, and he was sure that he held them to play with as he
pleased. All his trouble was to keep them sufficiently hot behind him
to prevent their turning off too soon. He ran cleanly, evenly, and
springily; the tailless leader not five yards behind him; and the Pack
tailing out over perhaps a quarter of a mile of ground, crazy and blind
with the rage of slaughter. So he kept his distance by ear, reserving
his last effort for the rush across the Bee Rocks.

The Little People had gone to sleep in the early twilight, for it
was not the season of late blossoming flowers; but as Mowgli’s first
foot-falls rang hollow on the hollow ground he heard a sound as though
all the earth were humming. Then he ran as he had never run in his life
before, spurned aside one--two--three of the piles of stones into the
dark, sweet-smelling gullies; heard a roar like the roar of the sea in a
cave; saw with the tail of his eye the air grow dark behind him; saw the
current of the Waingunga far below, and a flat, diamond-shaped head
in the water; leaped outward with all his strength, the tailless dhole
snapping at his shoulder in mid-air, and dropped feet first to the
safety of the river, breathless and triumphant. There was not a sting
upon him, for the smell of the garlic had checked the Little People for
just the few seconds that he was among them. When he rose Kaa’s coils
were steadying him and things were bounding over the edge of the
cliff--great lumps, it seemed, of clustered bees falling like plummets;
but before any lump touched water the bees flew upward and the body of a
dhole whirled down-stream. Overhead they could hear furious short yells
that were drowned in a roar like breakers--the roar of the wings of the
Little People of the Rocks. Some of the dholes, too, had fallen into the
gullies that communicated with the underground caves, and there choked
and fought and snapped among the tumbled honeycombs, and at last, borne
up, even when they were dead, on the heaving waves of bees beneath
them, shot out of some hole in the river-face, to roll over on the black
rubbish-heaps. There were dholes who had leaped short into the trees
on the cliffs, and the bees blotted out their shapes; but the greater
number of them, maddened by the stings, had flung themselves into the
river; and, as Kaa said, the Waingunga was hungry water.

Kaa held Mowgli fast till the boy had recovered his breath.

“We may not stay here,” he said. “The Little People are roused indeed.
Come!”

Swimming low and diving as often as he could, Mowgli went down the
river, knife in hand.

“Slowly, slowly,” said Kaa. “One tooth does not kill a hundred unless
it be a cobra’s, and many of the dholes took water swiftly when they saw
the Little People rise.”

“The more work for my knife, then. Phai! How the Little People follow!”
 Mowgli sank again. The face of the water was blanketed with wild bees,
buzzing sullenly and stinging all they found.

“Nothing was ever yet lost by silence,” said Kaa--no sting could
penetrate his scales--“and thou hast all the long night for the hunting.
Hear them howl!”

Nearly half the pack had seen the trap their fellows rushed into, and
turning sharp aside had flung themselves into the water where the gorge
broke down in steep banks. Their cries of rage and their threats against
the “tree-ape” who had brought them to their shame mixed with the yells
and growls of those who had been punished by the Little People. To
remain ashore was death, and every dhole knew it. Their pack was swept
along the current, down to the deep eddies of the Peace Pool, but even
there the angry Little People followed and forced them to the water
again. Mowgli could hear the voice of the tailless leader bidding his
people hold on and kill out every wolf in Seeonee. But he did not waste
his time in listening.

“One kills in the dark behind us!” snapped a dhole. “Here is tainted
water!”

Mowgli had dived forward like an otter, twitched a struggling dhole
under water before he could open his mouth, and dark rings rose as the
body plopped up, turning on its side. The dholes tried to turn, but the
current prevented them, and the Little People darted at the heads and
ears, and they could hear the challenge of the Seeonee Pack growing
louder and deeper in the gathering darkness. Again Mowgli dived, and
again a dhole went under, and rose dead, and again the clamour broke
out at the rear of the pack; some howling that it was best to go ashore,
others calling on their leader to lead them back to the Dekkan, and
others bidding Mowgli show himself and be killed.

“They come to the fight with two stomachs and several voices,” said Kaa.
“The rest is with thy brethren below yonder, The Little People go back
to sleep. They have chased us far. Now I, too, turn back, for I am not
of one skin with any wolf. Good hunting, Little Brother, and remember
the dhole bites low.”

A wolf came running along the bank on three legs, leaping up and down,
laying his head sideways close to the ground, hunching his back, and
breaking high into the air, as though he were playing with his cubs. It
was Won-tolla, the Outlier, and he said never a word, but continued his
horrible sport beside the dholes. They had been long in the water now,
and were swimming wearily, their coats drenched and heavy, their bushy
tails dragging like sponges, so tired and shaken that they, too, were
silent, watching the pair of blazing eyes that moved abreast.

“This is no good hunting,” said one, panting.

“Good hunting!” said Mowgli, as he rose boldly at the brute’s side, and
sent the long knife home behind the shoulder, pushing hard to avoid his
dying snap.

“Art thou there, Man-cub?” said Won-tolla across the water.

“Ask of the dead, Outlier,” Mowgli replied. “Have none come down-stream?
I have filled these dogs’ mouths with dirt; I have tricked them in the
broad daylight, and their leader lacks his tail, but here be some few
for thee still. Whither shall I drive them?”

“I will wait,” said Won-tolla. “The night is before me.”

Nearer and nearer came the bay of the Seeonee wolves. “For the Pack,
for the Full Pack it is met!” and a bend in the river drove the dholes
forward among the sands and shoals opposite the Lairs.

Then they saw their mistake. They should have landed half a mile higher
up, and rushed the wolves on dry ground. Now it was too late. The bank
was lined with burning eyes, and except for the horrible pheeal that had
never stopped since sundown, there was no sound in the Jungle. It seemed
as though Won-tolla were fawning on them to come ashore; and “Turn
and take hold!” said the leader of the dholes. The entire Pack flung
themselves at the shore, threshing and squattering through the shoal
water, till the face of the Waingunga was all white and torn, and the
great ripples went from side to side, like bow-waves from a boat. Mowgli
followed the rush, stabbing and slicing as the dholes, huddled together,
rushed up the river-beach in one wave.

Then the long fight began, heaving and straining and splitting and
scattering and narrowing and broadening along the red, wet sands, and
over and between the tangled tree-roots, and through and among the
bushes, and in and out of the grass clumps; for even now the dholes were
two to one. But they met wolves fighting for all that made the Pack,
and not only the short, high, deep-chested, white-tusked hunters of the
Pack, but the anxious-eyed lahinis--the she-wolves of the lair, as the
saying is--fighting for their litters, with here and there a yearling
wolf, his first coat still half woolly, tugging and grappling by their
sides. A wolf, you must know, flies at the throat or snaps at the flank,
while a dhole, by preference, bites at the belly; so when the dholes
were struggling out of the water and had to raise their heads, the odds
were with the wolves. On dry land the wolves suffered; but in the water
or ashore, Mowgli’s knife came and went without ceasing. The Four had
worried their way to his side. Gray Brother, crouched between the boy’s
knees, was protecting his stomach, while the others guarded his back
and either side, or stood over him when the shock of a leaping, yelling
dhole who had thrown himself full on the steady blade bore him down. For
the rest, it was one tangled confusion--a locked and swaying mob that
moved from right to left and from left to right along the bank; and also
ground round and round slowly on its own centre. Here would be a heaving
mound, like a water-blister in a whirlpool, which would break like a
water-blister, and throw up four or five mangled dogs, each striving to
get back to the centre; here would be a single wolf borne down by two or
three dholes, laboriously dragging them forward, and sinking the while;
here a yearling cub would be held up by the pressure round him, though
he had been killed early, while his mother, crazed with dumb rage,
rolled over and over, snapping, and passing on; and in the middle of the
thickest press, perhaps, one wolf and one dhole, forgetting everything
else, would be manoeuvring for first hold till they were whirled away by
a rush of furious fighters. Once Mowgli passed Akela, a dhole on either
flank, and his all but toothless jaws closed over the loins of a third;
and once he saw Phao, his teeth set in the throat of a dhole, tugging
the unwilling beast forward till the yearlings could finish him. But the
bulk of the fight was blind flurry and smother in the dark; hit, trip,
and tumble, yelp, groan, and worry-worry-worry, round him and behind him
and above him. As the night wore on, the quick, giddy-go-round motion
increased. The dholes were cowed and afraid to attack the stronger
wolves, but did not yet dare to run away. Mowgli felt that the end was
coming soon, and contented himself with striking merely to cripple. The
yearlings were growing bolder; there was time now and again to breathe,
and pass a word to a friend, and the mere flicker of the knife would
sometimes turn a dog aside.

“The meat is very near the bone,” Gray Brother yelled. He was bleeding
from a score of flesh-wounds.

“But the bone is yet to be cracked,” said Mowgli. “Eowawa! THUS do we do
in the Jungle!” The red blade ran like a flame along the side of a dhole
whose hind-quarters were hidden by the weight of a clinging wolf.

“My kill!” snorted the wolf through his wrinkled nostrils. “Leave him to
me.”

“Is thy stomach still empty, Outlier?” said Mowgli. Won-tolla was
fearfully punished, but his grip had paralysed the dhole, who could not
turn round and reach him.

“By the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli, with a bitter laugh, “it is
the tailless one!” And indeed it was the big bay-coloured leader.

“It is not wise to kill cubs and lahinis,” Mowgli went on
philosophically, wiping the blood out of his eyes, “unless one has also
killed the Outlier; and it is in my stomach that this Won-tolla kills
thee.”

A dhole leaped to his leader’s aid; but before his teeth had found
Won-tolla’s flank, Mowgli’s knife was in his throat, and Gray Brother
took what was left.

“And thus do we do in the Jungle,” said Mowgli.

Won-tolla said not a word, only his jaws were closing and closing on the
backbone as his life ebbed. The dhole shuddered, his head dropped, and
he lay still, and Won-tolla dropped above him.

“Huh! The Blood Debt is paid,” said Mowgli. “Sing the song, Won-tolla.”

“He hunts no more,” said Gray Brother; “and Akela, too, is silent this
long time.”

“The bone is cracked!” thundered Phao, son of Phaona. “They go! Kill,
kill out, O hunters of the Free People!”

Dhole after dhole was slinking away from those dark and bloody sands to
the river, to the thick Jungle, up-stream or down-stream as he saw the
road clear.

“The debt! The debt!” shouted Mowgli. “Pay the debt! They have slain the
Lone Wolf! Let not a dog go!”

He was flying to the river, knife in hand, to check any dhole who dared
to take water, when, from under a mound of nine dead, rose Akela’s head
and fore-quarters, and Mowgli dropped on his knees beside the Lone Wolf.

“Said I not it would be my last fight?” Akela gasped. “It is good
hunting. And thou, Little Brother?”

“I live, having killed many.”

“Even so. I die, and I would--I would die by thee, Little Brother.”

Mowgli took the terrible scarred head on his knees, and put his arms
round the torn neck.

“It is long since the old days of Shere Khan, and a Man-cub that rolled
naked in the dust.”

“Nay, nay, I am a wolf. I am of one skin with the Free People,” Mowgli
cried. “It is no will of mine that I am a man.”

“Thou art a man, Little Brother, wolfling of my watching. Thou art a
man, or else the Pack had fled before the dhole. My life I owe to thee,
and to-day thou hast saved the Pack even as once I saved thee. Hast thou
forgotten? All debts are paid now. Go to thine own people. I tell thee
again, eye of my eye, this hunting is ended. Go to thine own people.”

“I will never go. I will hunt alone in the Jungle. I have said it.”

“After the summer come the Rains, and after the Rains comes the spring.
Go back before thou art driven.”

“Who will drive me?”

“Mowgli will drive Mowgli. Go back to thy people. Go to Man.”

“When Mowgli drives Mowgli I will go,” Mowgli answered.

“There is no more to say,” said Akela. “Little Brother, canst thou raise
me to my feet? I also was a leader of the Free People.”

Very carefully and gently Mowgli lifted the bodies aside, and raised
Akela to his feet, both arms round him, and the Lone Wolf drew a long
breath, and began the Death Song that a leader of the Pack should sing
when he dies. It gathered strength as he went on, lifting and lifting,
and ringing far across the river, till it came to the last “Good
hunting!” and Akela shook himself clear of Mowgli for an instant, and,
leaping into the air, fell backward dead upon his last and most terrible
kill.

Mowgli sat with his head on his knees, careless of anything else, while
the remnant of the flying dholes were being overtaken and run down by
the merciless lahinis. Little by little the cries died away, and the
wolves returned limping, as their wounds stiffened, to take stock of the
losses. Fifteen of the Pack, as well as half a dozen lahinis, lay dead
by the river, and of the others not one was unmarked. And Mowgli sat
through it all till the cold daybreak, when Phao’s wet, red muzzle was
dropped in his hand, and Mowgli drew back to show the gaunt body of
Akela.

“Good hunting!” said Phao, as though Akela were still alive, and then
over his bitten shoulder to the others: “Howl, dogs! A Wolf has died
to-night!”

But of all the Pack of two hundred fighting dholes, whose boast was
that all jungles were their Jungle, and that no living thing could stand
before them, not one returned to the Dekkan to carry that word.




CHIL’S SONG

[This is the song that Chil sang as the kites dropped down one after
another to the river-bed, when the great fight was finished. Chil is
good friends with everybody, but he is a cold-blooded kind of creature
at heart, because he knows that almost everybody in the Jungle comes to
him in the long-run.]

     These were my companions going forth by night--
           (For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)
     Now come I to whistle them the ending of the fight.
           (Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)
     Word they gave me overhead of quarry newly slain,
     Word I gave them underfoot of buck upon the plain.
     Here’s an end of every trail--they shall not speak again!

     They that called the hunting-cry--they that followed fast--
           (For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)
     They that bade the sambhur wheel, or pinned him as he passed--
           (Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)
     They that lagged behind the scent--they that ran before,
     They that shunned the level horn--they that overbore.
     Here’s an end of every trail--they shall not follow more.
     These were my companions. Pity ‘twas they died!
           (For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)
     Now come I to comfort them that knew them in their pride.
           (Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)
     Tattered flank and sunken eye, open mouth and red,
     Locked and lank and lone they lie, the dead upon their dead.
     Here’s an end of every trail--and here my hosts are fed.




THE SPRING RUNNING

     Man goes to Man! Cry the challenge through the Jungle!
       He that was our Brother goes away.
     Hear, now, and judge, O ye People of the Jungle,--
       Answer, who shall turn him--who shall stay?

     Man goes to Man! He is weeping in the Jungle:
       He that was our Brother sorrows sore!
     Man goes to Man! (Oh, we loved him in the Jungle!)
       To the Man-Trail where we may not follow more.

The second year after the great fight with Red Dog and the death of
Akela, Mowgli must have been nearly seventeen years old. He looked
older, for hard exercise, the best of good eating, and baths whenever
he felt in the least hot or dusty, had given him strength and growth far
beyond his age. He could swing by one hand from a top branch for half
an hour at a time, when he had occasion to look along the tree-roads.
He could stop a young buck in mid-gallop and throw him sideways by the
head. He could even jerk over the big, blue wild boars that lived in
the Marshes of the North. The Jungle People who used to fear him for his
wits feared him now for his strength, and when he moved quietly on his
own affairs the mere whisper of his coming cleared the wood-paths. And
yet the look in his eyes was always gentle. Even when he fought, his
eyes never blazed as Bagheera’s did. They only grew more and more
interested and excited; and that was one of the things that Bagheera
himself did not understand.

He asked Mowgli about it, and the boy laughed and said. “When I miss the
kill I am angry. When I must go empty for two days I am very angry. Do
not my eyes talk then?”

“The mouth is hungry,” said Bagheera, “but the eyes say nothing.
Hunting, eating, or swimming, it is all one--like a stone in wet or dry
weather.” Mowgli looked at him lazily from under his long eyelashes,
and, as usual, the panther’s head dropped. Bagheera knew his master.

They were lying out far up the side of a hill overlooking the Waingunga,
and the morning mists hung below them in bands of white and green. As
the sun rose it changed into bubbling seas of red gold, churned off,
and let the low rays stripe the dried grass on which Mowgli and Bagheera
were resting. It was the end of the cold weather, the leaves and
the trees looked worn and faded, and there was a dry, ticking rustle
everywhere when the wind blew. A little leaf tap-tap-tapped furiously
against a twig, as a single leaf caught in a current will. It roused
Bagheera, for he snuffed the morning air with a deep, hollow cough,
threw himself on his back, and struck with his fore-paws at the nodding
leaf above.

“The year turns,” he said. “The Jungle goes forward. The Time of New
Talk is near. That leaf knows. It is very good.”

“The grass is dry,” Mowgli answered, pulling up a tuft. “Even
Eye-of-the-Spring [that is a little trumpet-shaped, waxy red flower
that runs in and out among the grasses]--even Eye-of-the Spring is shut,
and... Bagheera, IS it well for the Black Panther so to lie on his back
and beat with his paws in the air, as though he were the tree-cat?”

“Aowh?” said Bagheera. He seemed to be thinking of other things.

“I say, IS it well for the Black Panther so to mouth and cough, and howl
and roll? Remember, we be the Masters of the Jungle, thou and I.”

“Indeed, yes; I hear, Man-cub.” Bagheera rolled over hurriedly and sat
up, the dust on his ragged black flanks. (He was just casting his winter
coat.) “We be surely the Masters of the Jungle! Who is so strong as
Mowgli? Who so wise?” There was a curious drawl in the voice that made
Mowgli turn to see whether by any chance the Black Panther were making
fun of him, for the Jungle is full of words that sound like one thing,
but mean another. “I said we be beyond question the Masters of the
Jungle,” Bagheera repeated. “Have I done wrong? I did not know that the
Man-cub no longer lay upon the ground. Does he fly, then?”

Mowgli sat with his elbows on his knees, looking out across the valley
at the daylight. Somewhere down in the woods below a bird was trying
over in a husky, reedy voice the first few notes of his spring song.
It was no more than a shadow of the liquid, tumbling call he would be
pouring later, but Bagheera heard it.

“I said the Time of New Talk is near,” growled the panther, switching
his tail.

“I hear,” Mowgli answered. “Bagheera, why dost thou shake all over? The
sun is warm.”

“That is Ferao, the scarlet woodpecker,” said Bagheera. “HE has not
forgotten. Now I, too, must remember my song,” and he began purring and
crooning to himself, harking back dissatisfied again and again.

“There is no game afoot,” said Mowgli.

“Little Brother, are BOTH thine ears stopped? That is no killing-word,
but my song that I make ready against the need.”

“I had forgotten. I shall know when the Time of New Talk is here,
because then thou and the others all run away and leave me alone.”
 Mowgli spoke rather savagely.

“But, indeed, Little Brother,” Bagheera began, “we do not always----”

“I say ye do,” said Mowgli, shooting out his forefinger angrily. “Ye DO
run away, and I, who am the Master of the Jungle, must needs walk alone.
How was it last season, when I would gather sugar-cane from the fields
of a Man-Pack? I sent a runner--I sent thee!--to Hathi, bidding him to
come upon such a night and pluck the sweet grass for me with his trunk.”

“He came only two nights later,” said Bagheera, cowering a little; “and
of that long, sweet grass that pleased thee so he gathered more than any
Man-cub could eat in all the nights of the Rains. That was no fault of
mine.”

“He did not come upon the night when I sent him the word. No, he was
trumpeting and running and roaring through the valleys in the moonlight.
His trail was like the trail of three elephants, for he would not hide
among the trees. He danced in the moonlight before the houses of the
Man-Pack. I saw him, and yet he would not come to me; and _I_ am the
Master of the Jungle!”

“It was the Time of New Talk,” said the panther, always very humble.
“Perhaps, Little Brother, thou didst not that time call him by a
Master-word? Listen to Ferao, and be glad!”

Mowgli’s bad temper seemed to have boiled itself away. He lay back with
his head on his arms, his eyes shut. “I do not know--nor do I care,” he
said sleepily. “Let us sleep, Bagheera. My stomach is heavy in me. Make
me a rest for my head.”

The panther lay down again with a sigh, because he could hear Ferao
practising and repractising his song against the Springtime of New Talk,
as they say.

In an Indian Jungle the seasons slide one into the other almost without
division. There seem to be only two--the wet and the dry; but if you
look closely below the torrents of rain and the clouds of char and dust
you will find all four going round in their regular ring. Spring is the
most wonderful, because she has not to cover a clean, bare field with
new leaves and flowers, but to drive before her and to put away the
hanging-on, over-surviving raffle of half-green things which the gentle
winter has suffered to live, and to make the partly-dressed stale earth
feel new and young once more. And this she does so well that there is no
spring in the world like the Jungle spring.

There is one day when all things are tired, and the very smells, as they
drift on the heavy air, are old and used. One cannot explain this, but
it feels so. Then there is another day--to the eye nothing whatever has
changed--when all the smells are new and delightful, and the whiskers of
the Jungle People quiver to their roots, and the winter hair comes away
from their sides in long, draggled locks. Then, perhaps, a little rain
falls, and all the trees and the bushes and the bamboos and the mosses
and the juicy-leaved plants wake with a noise of growing that you can
almost hear, and under this noise runs, day and night, a deep hum. THAT
is the noise of the spring--a vibrating boom which is neither bees, nor
falling water, nor the wind in tree-tops, but the purring of the warm,
happy world.

Up to this year Mowgli had always delighted in the turn of the seasons.
It was he who generally saw the first Eye-of-the-Spring deep down among
the grasses, and the first bank of spring clouds, which are like nothing
else in the Jungle. His voice could be heard in all sorts of wet,
star-lighted, blossoming places, helping the big frogs through their
choruses, or mocking the little upside-down owls that hoot through the
white nights. Like all his people, spring was the season he chose for
his flittings--moving, for the mere joy of rushing through the warm air,
thirty, forty, or fifty miles between twilight and the morning star, and
coming back panting and laughing and wreathed with strange flowers. The
Four did not follow him on these wild ringings of the Jungle, but went
off to sing songs with other wolves. The Jungle People are very busy
in the spring, and Mowgli could hear them grunting and screaming and
whistling according to their kind. Their voices then are different from
their voices at other times of the year, and that is one of the reasons
why spring in the Jungle is called the Time of New Talk.

But that spring, as he told Bagheera, his stomach was changed in him.
Ever since the bamboo shoots turned spotty-brown he had been looking
forward to the morning when the smells should change. But when the
morning came, and Mor the Peacock, blazing in bronze and blue and gold,
cried it aloud all along the misty woods, and Mowgli opened his mouth to
send on the cry, the words choked between his teeth, and a feeling came
over him that began at his toes and ended in his hair--a feeling of pure
unhappiness, so that he looked himself over to be sure that he had not
trod on a thorn. Mor cried the new smells, the other birds took it
over, and from the rocks by the Waingunga he heard Bagheera’s hoarse
scream--something between the scream of an eagle and the neighing of
a horse. There was a yelling and scattering of Bandar-log in the
new-budding branches above, and there stood Mowgli, his chest, filled to
answer Mor, sinking in little gasps as the breath was driven out of it
by this unhappiness.

He stared all round him, but he could see no more than the mocking
Bandar-log scudding through the trees, and Mor, his tail spread in full
splendour, dancing on the slopes below.

“The smells have changed,” screamed Mor. “Good hunting, Little Brother!
Where is thy answer?”

“Little Brother, good hunting!” whistled Chil the Kite and his mate,
swooping down together. The two baffed under Mowgli’s nose so close that
a pinch of downy white feathers brushed away.

A light spring rain--elephant-rain they call it--drove across the Jungle
in a belt half a mile wide, left the new leaves wet and nodding behind,
and died out in a double rainbow and a light roll of thunder. The spring
hum broke out for a minute, and was silent, but all the Jungle Folk
seemed to be giving tongue at once. All except Mowgli.

“I have eaten good food,” he said to himself. “I have drunk good
water. Nor does my throat burn and grow small, as it did when I bit the
blue-spotted root that Oo the Turtle said was clean food. But my stomach
is heavy, and I have given very bad talk to Bagheera and others, people
of the Jungle and my people. Now, too, I am hot and now I am cold, and
now I am neither hot nor cold, but angry with that which I cannot see.
Huhu! It is time to make a running! To-night I will cross the ranges;
yes, I will make a spring running to the Marshes of the North, and back
again. I have hunted too easily too long. The Four shall come with me,
for they grow as fat as white grubs.”

He called, but never one of the Four answered. They were far beyond
earshot, singing over the spring songs--the Moon and Sambhur Songs--with
the wolves of the pack; for in the spring-time the Jungle People make
very little difference between the day and the night. He gave the sharp,
barking note, but his only answer was the mocking maiou of the little
spotted tree-cat winding in and out among the branches for early birds’
nests. At this he shook all over with rage, and half drew his knife.
Then he became very haughty, though there was no one to see him, and
stalked severely down the hillside, chin up and eyebrows down. But never
a single one of his people asked him a question, for they were all too
busy with their own affairs.

“Yes,” said Mowgli to himself, though in his heart he knew that he had
no reason. “Let the Red Dhole come from the Dekkan, or the Red Flower
dance among the bamboos, and all the Jungle runs whining to Mowgli,
calling him great elephant-names. But now, because Eye-of-the-Spring is
red, and Mor, forsooth, must show his naked legs in some spring dance,
the Jungle goes mad as Tabaqui.... By the Bull that bought me! am I the
Master of the Jungle, or am I not? Be silent! What do ye here?”

A couple of young wolves of the Pack were cantering down a path, looking
for open ground in which to fight. (You will remember that the Law of
the Jungle forbids fighting where the Pack can see.) Their neck-bristles
were as stiff as wire, and they bayed furiously, crouching for the first
grapple. Mowgli leaped forward, caught one outstretched throat in either
hand, expecting to fling the creatures backward as he had often done in
games or Pack hunts. But he had never before interfered with a spring
fight. The two leaped forward and dashed him aside, and without word to
waste rolled over and over close locked.

Mowgli was on his feet almost before he fell, his knife and his white
teeth were bared, and at that minute he would have killed both for no
reason but that they were fighting when he wished them to be quiet,
although every wolf has full right under the Law to fight. He danced
round them with lowered shoulders and quivering hand, ready to send in
a double blow when the first flurry of the scuffle should be over;
but while he waited the strength seemed to ebb from his body, the
knife-point lowered, and he sheathed the knife and watched.

“I have surely eaten poison,” he sighed at last. “Since I broke up the
Council with the Red Flower--since I killed Shere Khan--none of the Pack
could fling me aside. And these be only tail-wolves in the Pack, little
hunters! My strength is gone from me, and presently I shall die. Oh,
Mowgli, why dost thou not kill them both?”

The fight went on till one wolf ran away, and Mowgli was left alone on
the torn and bloody ground, looking now at his knife, and now at his
legs and arms, while the feeling of unhappiness he had never known
before covered him as water covers a log.

He killed early that evening and ate but little, so as to be in good
fettle for his spring running, and he ate alone because all the Jungle
People were away singing or fighting. It was a perfect white night,
as they call it. All green things seemed to have made a month’s growth
since the morning. The branch that was yellow-leaved the day before
dripped sap when Mowgli broke it. The mosses curled deep and warm over
his feet, the young grass had no cutting edges, and all the voices of
the Jungle boomed like one deep harp-string touched by the moon--the
Moon of New Talk, who splashed her light full on rock and pool, slipped
it between trunk and creeper, and sifted it through a million leaves.
Forgetting his unhappiness, Mowgli sang aloud with pure delight as he
settled into his stride. It was more like flying than anything else, for
he had chosen the long downward slope that leads to the Northern Marshes
through the heart of the main Jungle, where the springy ground deadened
the fall of his feet. A man-taught man would have picked his way with
many stumbles through the cheating moonlight, but Mowgli’s muscles,
trained by years of experience, bore him up as though he were a feather.
When a rotten log or a hidden stone turned under his foot he saved
himself, never checking his pace, without effort and without thought.
When he tired of ground-going he threw up his hands monkey-fashion to
the nearest creeper, and seemed to float rather than to climb up into
the thin branches, whence he would follow a tree-road till his mood
changed, and he shot downward in a long, leafy curve to the levels
again. There were still, hot hollows surrounded by wet rocks where he
could hardly breathe for the heavy scents of the night flowers and the
bloom along the creeper buds; dark avenues where the moonlight lay in
belts as regular as checkered marbles in a church aisle; thickets where
the wet young growth stood breast-high about him and threw its arms
round his waist; and hilltops crowned with broken rock, where he leaped
from stone to stone above the lairs of the frightened little foxes. He
would hear, very faint and far off, the chug-drug of a boar sharpening
his tusks on a bole; and would come across the great gray brute all
alone, scribing and rending the bark of a tall tree, his mouth dripping
with foam, and his eyes blazing like fire. Or he would turn aside to the
sound of clashing horns and hissing grunts, and dash past a couple of
furious sambhur, staggering to and fro with lowered heads, striped with
blood that showed black in the moonlight. Or at some rushing ford he
would hear Jacala the Crocodile bellowing like a bull, or disturb a
twined knot of the Poison People, but before they could strike he would
be away and across the glistening shingle, and deep in the Jungle again.

So he ran, sometimes shouting, sometimes singing to himself, the
happiest thing in all the Jungle that night, till the smell of the
flowers warned him that he was near the marshes, and those lay far
beyond his farthest hunting-grounds.

Here, again, a man-trained man would have sunk overhead in three
strides, but Mowgli’s feet had eyes in them, and they passed him from
tussock to tussock and clump to quaking clump without asking help from
the eyes in his head. He ran out to the middle of the swamp, disturbing
the duck as he ran, and sat down on a moss-coated tree-trunk lapped in
the black water. The marsh was awake all round him, for in the spring
the Bird People sleep very lightly, and companies of them were coming
or going the night through. But no one took any notice of Mowgli sitting
among the tall reeds humming songs without words, and looking at the
soles of his hard brown feet in case of neglected thorns. All his
unhappiness seemed to have been left behind in his own Jungle, and he
was just beginning a full-throat song when it came back again--ten times
worse than before.

This time Mowgli was frightened. “It is here also!” he said half aloud.
“It has followed me,” and he looked over his shoulder to see whether
the It were not standing behind him. “There is no one here.” The night
noises of the marsh went on, but never a bird or beast spoke to him, and
the new feeling of misery grew.

“I have surely eaten poison,” he said in an awe-stricken voice. “It must
be that carelessly I have eaten poison, and my strength is going from
me. I was afraid--and yet it was not _I_ that was afraid--Mowgli was
afraid when the two wolves fought. Akela, or even Phao, would have
silenced them; yet Mowgli was afraid. That is true sign I have eaten
poison.... But what do they care in the Jungle? They sing and howl and
fight, and run in companies under the moon, and I--Hai-mai!--I am dying
in the marshes, of that poison which I have eaten.” He was so sorry for
himself that he nearly wept. “And after,” he went on, “they will find
me lying in the black water. Nay, I will go back to my own Jungle, and I
will die upon the Council Rock, and Bagheera, whom I love, if he is not
screaming in the valley--Bagheera, perhaps, may watch by what is left
for a little, lest Chil use me as he used Akela.”

A large, warm tear splashed down on his knee, and, miserable as he was,
Mowgli felt happy that he was so miserable, if you can understand
that upside-down sort of happiness. “As Chil the Kite used Akela,” he
repeated, “on the night I saved the Pack from Red Dog.” He was quiet
for a little, thinking of the last words of the Lone Wolf, which you,
of course, remember. “Now Akela said to me many foolish things before he
died, for when we die our stomachs change. He said... None the less, I
AM of the Jungle!”

In his excitement, as he remembered the fight on Waingunga bank, he
shouted the last words aloud, and a wild buffalo-cow among the reeds
sprang to her knees, snorting, “Man!”

“Uhh!” said Mysa the Wild Buffalo (Mowgli could hear him turn in his
wallow), “THAT is no man. It is only the hairless wolf of the Seeonee
Pack. On such nights runs he to and fro.”

“Uhh!” said the cow, dropping her head again to graze, “I thought it was
Man.”

“I say no. Oh, Mowgli, is it danger?” lowed Mysa.

“Oh, Mowgli, is it danger?” the boy called back mockingly. “That is all
Mysa thinks for: Is it danger? But for Mowgli, who goes to and fro in
the Jungle by night, watching, what do ye care?”

“How loud he cries!” said the cow. “Thus do they cry,” Mysa answered
contemptuously, “who, having torn up the grass, know not how to eat it.”

“For less than this,” Mowgli groaned to himself, “for less than this even
last Rains I had pricked Mysa out of his wallow, and ridden him through
the swamp on a rush halter.” He stretched a hand to break one of the
feathery reeds, but drew it back with a sigh. Mysa went on steadily
chewing the cud, and the long grass ripped where the cow grazed. “I will
not die HERE,” he said angrily. “Mysa, who is of one blood with Jacala
and the pig, would see me. Let us go beyond the swamp and see what
comes. Never have I run such a spring running--hot and cold together.
Up, Mowgli!”

He could not resist the temptation of stealing across the reeds to Mysa
and pricking him with the point of his knife. The great dripping bull
broke out of his wallow like a shell exploding, while Mowgli laughed
till he sat down.

“Say now that the hairless wolf of the Seeonee Pack once herded thee,
Mysa,” he called.

“Wolf! THOU?” the bull snorted, stamping in the mud. “All the jungle
knows thou wast a herder of tame cattle--such a man’s brat as shouts in
the dust by the crops yonder. THOU of the Jungle! What hunter would have
crawled like a snake among the leeches, and for a muddy jest--a jackal’s
jest--have shamed me before my cow? Come to firm ground, and I will--I
will...” Mysa frothed at the mouth, for Mysa has nearly the worst temper
of any one in the Jungle.

Mowgli watched him puff and blow with eyes that never changed. When
he could make himself heard through the pattering mud, he said: “What
Man-Pack lair here by the marshes, Mysa? This is new Jungle to me.”

“Go north, then,” roared the angry bull, for Mowgli had pricked him
rather sharply. “It was a naked cow-herd’s jest. Go and tell them at the
village at the foot of the marsh.”

“The Man-Pack do not love jungle-tales, nor do I think, Mysa, that a
scratch more or less on thy hide is any matter for a council. But I will
go and look at this village. Yes, I will go. Softly now. It is not every
night that the Master of the Jungle comes to herd thee.”

He stepped out to the shivering ground on the edge of the marsh, well
knowing that Mysa would never charge over it and laughed, as he ran, to
think of the bull’s anger.

“My strength is not altogether gone,” he said. “It may be that the poison
is not to the bone. There is a star sitting low yonder.” He looked at it
between his half-shut hands. “By the Bull that bought me, it is the Red
Flower--the Red Flower that I lay beside before--before I came even
to the first Seeonee Pack! Now that I have seen, I will finish the
running.”

The marsh ended in a broad plain where a light twinkled. It was a long
time since Mowgli had concerned himself with the doings of men, but this
night the glimmer of the Red Flower drew him forward.

“I will look,” said he, “as I did in the old days, and I will see how
far the Man-Pack has changed.”

Forgetting that he was no longer in his own Jungle, where he could do
what he pleased, he trod carelessly through the dew-loaded grasses till
he came to the hut where the light stood. Three or four yelping dogs
gave tongue, for he was on the outskirts of a village.

“Ho!” said Mowgli, sitting down noiselessly, after sending back a deep
wolf-growl that silenced the curs. “What comes will come. Mowgli, what
hast thou to do any more with the lairs of the Man-Pack?” He rubbed his
mouth, remembering where a stone had struck it years ago when the other
Man-Pack had cast him out.

The door of the hut opened, and a woman stood peering out into the
darkness. A child cried, and the woman said over her shoulder, “Sleep.
It was but a jackal that waked the dogs. In a little time morning
comes.”

Mowgli in the grass began to shake as though he had fever. He knew that
voice well, but to make sure he cried softly, surprised to find how
man’s talk came back, “Messua! O Messua!”

“Who calls?” said the woman, a quiver in her voice.

“Hast thou forgotten?” said Mowgli. His throat was dry as he spoke.

“If it be THOU, what name did I give thee? Say!” She had half shut the
door, and her hand was clutching at her breast.

“Nathoo! Ohe, Nathoo!” said Mowgli, for, as you remember, that was the
name Messua gave him when he first came to the Man-Pack.

“Come, my son,” she called, and Mowgli stepped into the light, and
looked full at Messua, the woman who had been good to him, and whose
life he had saved from the Man-Pack so long before. She was older,
and her hair was gray, but her eyes and her voice had not changed.
Woman-like, she expected to find Mowgli where she had left him, and her
eyes travelled upward in a puzzled way from his chest to his head, that
touched the top of the door.

“My son,” she stammered; and then, sinking to his feet: “But it is no
longer my son. It is a Godling of the Woods! Ahai!”

As he stood in the red light of the oil-lamp, strong, tall, and
beautiful, his long black hair sweeping over his shoulders, the knife
swinging at his neck, and his head crowned with a wreath of white
jasmine, he might easily have been mistaken for some wild god of a
jungle legend. The child half asleep on a cot sprang up and shrieked
aloud with terror. Messua turned to soothe him, while Mowgli stood
still, looking in at the water-jars and the cooking-pots, the grain-bin,
and all the other human belongings that he found himself remembering so
well.

“What wilt thou eat or drink?” Messua murmured. “This is all thine. We
owe our lives to thee. But art thou him I called Nathoo, or a Godling,
indeed?”

“I am Nathoo,” said Mowgli, “I am very far from my own place. I saw this
light, and came hither. I did not know thou wast here.”

“After we came to Khanhiwara,” Messua said timidly, “the English
would have helped us against those villagers that sought to burn us.
Rememberest thou?”

“Indeed, I have not forgotten.”

“But when the English Law was made ready, we went to the village of
those evil people, and it was no more to be found.”

“That also I remember,” said Mowgli, with a quiver of his nostril.

“My man, therefore, took service in the fields, and at last--for,
indeed, he was a strong man--we held a little land here. It is not so
rich as the old village, but we do not need much--we two.”

“Where is he the man that dug in the dirt when he was afraid on that
night?”

“He is dead--a year.”

“And he?” Mowgli pointed to the child.

“My son that was born two Rains ago. If thou art a Godling, give him the
Favour of the Jungle, that he may be safe among thy--thy people, as we
were safe on that night.”

She lifted up the child, who, forgetting his fright, reached out to play
with the knife that hung on Mowgli’s chest, and Mowgli put the little
fingers aside very carefully.

“And if thou art Nathoo whom the tiger carried away,” Messua went on,
choking, “he is then thy younger brother. Give him an elder brother’s
blessing.”

“Hai-mai! What do I know of the thing called a blessing? I am neither
a Godling nor his brother, and--O mother, mother, my heart is heavy in
me.” He shivered as he set down the child.

“Like enough,” said Messua, bustling among the cooking-pots. “This comes
of running about the marshes by night. Beyond question, the fever
had soaked thee to the marrow.” Mowgli smiled a little at the idea of
anything in the Jungle hurting him. “I will make a fire, and thou shalt
drink warm milk. Put away the jasmine wreath: the smell is heavy in so
small a place.”

Mowgli sat down, muttering, with his face in his hands. All manner of
strange feelings that he had never felt before were running over him,
exactly as though he had been poisoned, and he felt dizzy and a little
sick. He drank the warm milk in long gulps, Messua patting him on the
shoulder from time to time, not quite sure whether he were her son
Nathoo of the long ago days, or some wonderful Jungle being, but glad to
feel that he was at least flesh and blood.

“Son,” she said at last,--her eyes were full of pride,--“have any told
thee that thou art beautiful beyond all men?”

“Hah?” said Mowgli, for naturally he had never heard anything of the
kind. Messua laughed softly and happily. The look in his face was enough
for her.

“I am the first, then? It is right, though it comes seldom, that a
mother should tell her son these good things. Thou art very beautiful.
Never have I looked upon such a man.”

Mowgli twisted his head and tried to see over his own hard shoulder, and
Messua laughed again so long that Mowgli, not knowing why, was forced to
laugh with her, and the child ran from one to the other, laughing too.

“Nay, thou must not mock thy brother,” said Messua, catching him to
her breast. “When thou art one-half as fair we will marry thee to the
youngest daughter of a king, and thou shalt ride great elephants.”

Mowgli could not understand one word in three of the talk here; the warm
milk was taking effect on him after his long run, so he curled up and
in a minute was deep asleep, and Messua put the hair back from his eyes,
threw a cloth over him, and was happy. Jungle-fashion, he slept out the
rest of that night and all the next day; for his instincts, which never
wholly slept, warned him there was nothing to fear. He waked at last
with a bound that shook the hut, for the cloth over his face made him
dream of traps; and there he stood, his hand on his knife, the sleep all
heavy in his rolling eyes, ready for any fight.

Messua laughed, and set the evening meal before him. There were only
a few coarse cakes baked over the smoky fire, some rice, and a lump of
sour preserved tamarinds--just enough to go on with till he could get
to his evening kill. The smell of the dew in the marshes made him hungry
and restless. He wanted to finish his spring running, but the child
insisted on sitting in his arms, and Messua would have it that his long,
blue-black hair must be combed out. So she sang, as she combed, foolish
little baby-songs, now calling Mowgli her son, and now begging him to
give some of his jungle power to the child. The hut door was closed, but
Mowgli heard a sound he knew well, and saw Messua’s jaw drop with horror
as a great gray paw came under the bottom of the door, and Gray Brother
outside whined a muffled and penitent whine of anxiety and fear.

“Out and wait! Ye would not come when I called,” said Mowgli in
Jungle-talk, without turning his head, and the great gray paw
disappeared.

“Do not--do not bring thy--thy servants with thee,” said Messua. “I--we
have always lived at peace with the Jungle.”

“It is peace,” said Mowgli, rising. “Think of that night on the road to
Khanhiwara. There were scores of such folk before thee and behind
thee. But I see that even in springtime the Jungle People do not always
forget. Mother, I go.”

Messua drew aside humbly--he was indeed a wood-god, she thought; but as
his hand was on the door the mother in her made her throw her arms round
Mowgli’s neck again and again.

“Come back!” she whispered. “Son or no son, come back, for I love
thee--Look, he too grieves.”

The child was crying because the man with the shiny knife was going
away.

“Come back again,” Messua repeated. “By night or by day this door is
never shut to thee.”

Mowgli’s throat worked as though the cords in it were being pulled, and
his voice seemed to be dragged from it as he answered, “I will surely
come back.”

“And now,” he said, as he put by the head of the fawning wolf on the
threshold, “I have a little cry against thee, Gray Brother. Why came ye
not all four when I called so long ago?”

“So long ago? It was but last night. I--we--were singing in the Jungle
the new songs, for this is the Time of New Talk. Rememberest thou?”

“Truly, truly.”

“And as soon as the songs were sung,” Gray Brother went on earnestly,
“I followed thy trail. I ran from all the others and followed hot-foot.
But, O Little Brother, what hast THOU done, eating and sleeping with the
Man-Pack?”

“If ye had come when I called, this had never been,” said Mowgli,
running much faster.

“And now what is to be?” said Gray Brother. Mowgli was going to answer
when a girl in a white cloth came down some path that led from the
outskirts of the village. Gray Brother dropped out of sight at once, and
Mowgli backed noiselessly into a field of high-springing crops. He could
almost have touched her with his hand when the warm, green stalks closed
before his face and he disappeared like a ghost. The girl screamed, for
she thought she had seen a spirit, and then she gave a deep sigh. Mowgli
parted the stalks with his hands and watched her till she was out of
sight.

“And now I do not know,” he said, sighing in his turn. “WHY did ye not
come when I called?”

“We follow thee--we follow thee,” Gray Brother mumbled, licking at
Mowgli’s heel. “We follow thee always, except in the Time of the New
Talk.”

“And would ye follow me to the Man-Pack?” Mowgli whispered.

“Did I not follow thee on the night our old Pack cast thee out? Who
waked thee lying among the crops?”

“Ay, but again?”

“Have I not followed thee to-night?”

“Ay, but again and again, and it may be again, Gray Brother?”

Gray Brother was silent. When he spoke he growled to himself, “The Black
One spoke truth.”

“And he said?”

“Man goes to Man at the last. Raksha, our mother, said----”

“So also said Akela on the night of Red Dog,” Mowgli muttered.

“So also says Kaa, who is wiser than us all.”

“What dost thou say, Gray Brother?”

“They cast thee out once, with bad talk. They cut thy mouth with stones.
They sent Buldeo to slay thee. They would have thrown thee into the Red
Flower. Thou, and not I, hast said that they are evil and senseless.
Thou, and not I--I follow my own people--didst let in the Jungle upon
them. Thou, and not I, didst make song against them more bitter even
than our song against Red Dog.”

“I ask thee what THOU sayest?”

They were talking as they ran. Gray Brother cantered on a while
without replying, and then he said,--between bound and bound as it
were,--“Man-cub--Master of the Jungle--Son of Raksha, Lair-brother to
me--though I forget for a little while in the spring, thy trail is my
trail, thy lair is my lair, thy kill is my kill, and thy death-fight
is my death-fight. I speak for the Three. But what wilt thou say to the
Jungle?”

“That is well thought. Between the sight and the kill it is not good to
wait. Go before and cry them all to the Council Rock, and I will tell
them what is in my stomach. But they may not come--in the Time of New
Talk they may forget me.”

“Hast thou, then, forgotten nothing?” snapped Gray Brother over his
shoulder, as he laid himself down to gallop, and Mowgli followed,
thinking.

At any other season the news would have called all the Jungle together
with bristling necks, but now they were busy hunting and fighting and
killing and singing. From one to another Gray Brother ran, crying, “The
Master of the Jungle goes back to Man! Come to the Council Rock.” And
the happy, eager People only answered, “He will return in the summer
heats. The Rains will drive him to lair. Run and sing with us, Gray
Brother.”

“But the Master of the Jungle goes back to Man,” Gray Brother would
repeat.

“Eee--Yoawa? Is the Time of New Talk any less sweet for that?” they
would reply. So when Mowgli, heavy-hearted, came up through the
well-remembered rocks to the place where he had been brought into the
Council, he found only the Four, Baloo, who was nearly blind with age,
and the heavy, cold-blooded Kaa coiled around Akela’s empty seat.

“Thy trail ends here, then, Manling?” said Kaa, as Mowgli threw himself
down, his face in his hands. “Cry thy cry. We be of one blood, thou and
I--man and snake together.”

“Why did I not die under Red Dog?” the boy moaned. “My strength is gone
from me, and it is not any poison. By night and by day I hear a double
step upon my trail. When I turn my head it is as though one had hidden
himself from me that instant. I go to look behind the trees and he is
not there. I call and none cry again; but it is as though one listened
and kept back the answer. I lie down, but I do not rest. I run the
spring running, but I am not made still. I bathe, but I am not made
cool. The kill sickens me, but I have no heart to fight except I kill.
The Red Flower is in my body, my bones are water--and--I know not what I
know.”

“What need of talk?” said Baloo slowly, turning his head to where Mowgli
lay. “Akela by the river said it, that Mowgli should drive Mowgli
back to the Man-Pack. I said it. But who listens now to Baloo?
Bagheera--where is Bagheera this night?--he knows also. It is the Law.”

“When we met at Cold Lairs, Manling, I knew it,” said Kaa, turning a
little in his mighty coils. “Man goes to Man at the last, though the
Jungle does not cast him out.”

The Four looked at one another and at Mowgli, puzzled but obedient.

“The Jungle does not cast me out, then?” Mowgli stammered.

Gray Brother and the Three growled furiously, beginning, “So long as we
live none shall dare----” But Baloo checked them.

“I taught thee the Law. It is for me to speak,” he said; “and, though I
cannot now see the rocks before me, I see far. Little Frog, take thine
own trail; make thy lair with thine own blood and pack and people; but
when there is need of foot or tooth or eye, or a word carried swiftly by
night, remember, Master of the Jungle, the Jungle is thine at call.”

“The Middle Jungle is thine also,” said Kaa. “I speak for no small
people.”

“Hai-mai, my brothers,” cried Mowgli, throwing up his arms with a sob.
“I know not what I know! I would not go; but I am drawn by both feet.
How shall I leave these nights?”

“Nay, look up, Little Brother,” Baloo repeated. “There is no shame in
this hunting. When the honey is eaten we leave the empty hive.”

“Having cast the skin,” said Kaa, “we may not creep into it afresh. It
is the Law.”

“Listen, dearest of all to me,” said Baloo. There is neither word nor
will here to hold thee back. Look up! Who may question the Master of the
Jungle? I saw thee playing among the white pebbles yonder when thou wast
a little frog; and Bagheera, that bought thee for the price of a young
bull newly killed, saw thee also. Of that Looking Over we two only
remain; for Raksha, thy lair-mother, is dead with thy lair-father; the
old Wolf-Pack is long since dead; thou knowest whither Shere Khan went,
and Akela died among the dholes, where, but for thy wisdom and strength,
the second Seeonee Pack would also have died. There remains nothing but
old bones. It is no longer the Man-cub that asks leave of his Pack, but
the Master of the Jungle that changes his trail. Who shall question Man
in his ways?”

“But Bagheera and the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli. “I would
not----”

His words were cut short by a roar and a crash in the thicket below, and
Bagheera, light, strong, and terrible as always, stood before him.

“Therefore,” he said, stretching out a dripping right paw, “I did not
come. It was a long hunt, but he lies dead in the bushes now--a bull in
his second year--the Bull that frees thee, Little Brother. All debts
are paid now. For the rest, my word is Baloo’s word.” He licked Mowgli’s
foot. “Remember, Bagheera loved thee,” he cried, and bounded away. At
the foot of the hill he cried again long and loud, “Good hunting on a
new trail, Master of the Jungle! Remember, Bagheera loved thee.”

“Thou hast heard,” said Baloo. “There is no more. Go now; but first come
to me. O wise Little Frog, come to me!”

“It is hard to cast the skin,” said Kaa as Mowgli sobbed and sobbed,
with his head on the blind bear’s side and his arms round his neck,
while Baloo tried feebly to lick his feet.

“The stars are thin,” said Gray Brother, snuffing at the dawn wind.
“Where shall we lair to-day? for from now, we follow new trails.”

THE OUTSONG

[This is the song that Mowgli heard behind him in the Jungle till he
came to Messua’s door again.]

     Baloo

     For the sake of him who showed
     One wise Frog the Jungle-Road,
     Keep the Law the Man-Pack make--
     For thy blind old Baloo’s sake!
     Clean or tainted, hot or stale,
     Hold it as it were the Trail,
     Through the day and through the night,
     Questing neither left nor right.
     For the sake of him who loves
     Thee beyond all else that moves,
     When thy Pack would make thee pain,
     Say: “Tabaqui sings again.”
      When thy Pack would work thee ill,
     Say: “Shere Khan is yet to kill.”
      When the knife is drawn to slay,
     Keep the Law and go thy way.
     (Root and honey, palm and spathe,
     Guard a cub from harm and scathe!)
     Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,
     Jungle-Favour go with thee!


     Kaa

     Anger is the egg of Fear--
     Only lidless eyes are clear.
     Cobra-poison none may leech.
     Even so with Cobra-speech.
     Open talk shall call to thee
     Strength, whose mate is Courtesy.
     Send no lunge beyond thy length;
     Lend no rotten bough thy strength.
     Gauge thy gape with buck or goat,
     Lest thine eye should choke thy throat,
     After gorging, wouldst thou sleep?
     Look thy den is hid and deep,
     Lest a wrong, by thee forgot,
     Draw thy killer to the spot.
     East and West and North and South,
     Wash thy hide and close thy mouth.
     (Pit and rift and blue pool-brim,
     Middle-Jungle follow him!)
     Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,
     Jungle-Favour go with thee!


     Bagheera

     In the cage my life began;
     Well I know the worth of Man.
     By the Broken Lock that freed--
     Man-cub, ‘ware the Man-cub’s breed!
     Scenting-dew or starlight pale,
     Choose no tangled tree-cat trail.
     Pack or council, hunt or den,
     Cry no truce with Jackal-Men.
     Feed them silence when they say:
     “Come with us an easy way.”
      Feed them silence when they seek
     Help of thine to hurt the weak.
     Make no banaar’s boast of skill;
     Hold thy peace above the kill.
     Let nor call nor song nor sign
     Turn thee from thy hunting-line.
     (Morning mist or twilight clear,
     Serve him, Wardens of the Deer!)
     Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,
     Jungle-Favour go with thee!


     The Three

     On the trail that thou must tread
     To the thresholds of our dread,
     Where the Flower blossoms red;
     Through the nights when thou shalt lie
     Prisoned from our Mother-sky,
     Hearing us, thy loves, go by;
     In the dawns when thou shalt wake
     To the toil thou canst not break,
     Heartsick for the Jungle’s sake:
     Wood and Water, Wind and Tree,
     Wisdom, Strength, and Courtesy,
     Jungle-Favour go with thee!
