the wise of #heart will receive commandments but a babbling fool will come to ruin

a wise #son makes a glad father but a foolish man despises his mother

an evildoer listens to wicked lips and a liar gives ear to a mischievous #tongue

whoever says to the wicked you are in the right will be cursed by peoples abhorred by nations but those who rebuke the #wicked will have delight and a good blessing will come upon them

the #sluggard says there is a lion in the road there is a lion in the streets 

like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent #lips with an evil heart

better is a #neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away

a false balance is an #abomination to the lord but a just weight is his delight

in a multitude of people is the glory of a #king but without people a prince is ruined
