know that wisdom is such to your soul if you find it there will be a future and your #hope will not be cut off

lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous do no violence to his home for the righteous falls seven times and rises again but the wicked stumble in times of #calamity

do not rejoice when your enemy falls and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles lest the lord see it and be displeased and turn away his #anger from him

fret not yourself because of evildoers and be not envious of the wicked for the evil man has no future the #lamp of the wicked will be put out

my #son fear the lord and the king and do not join with those who do otherwise for disaster will arise suddenly from them and who knows the ruin that will come from them both

#partiality in judging is not good

whoever gives an honest answer kisses the #lips

prepare your work outside get everything ready for yourself in the field and after that build your #house

be not a witness against your #neighbor without cause and do not deceive with your lips

do not say i will do to him as he has done to me i will #pay the man back for what he has done

i passed by the field of a #sluggard by the vineyard of a man lacking sense and behold it was all overgrown with thorns the ground was covered with nettles and its stone wall was broken down

a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest and #poverty will come upon you like a robber and want like an armed man

it is the #glory of god to conceal things but the glory of kings is to search things out

as the heavens for height and the earth for depth so the #heart of kings is unsearchable

take away the dross from the silver and the smith has material for a vessel take away the wicked from the presence of the #king and his throne will be established in righteousness

do not put yourself forward in the kings #presence or stand in the place of the great for it is better to be told come up here than to be put lower in the presence of a noble

what your eyes have seen do not hastily bring into court for what will you do in the end when your #neighbor puts you to shame argue your case with your neighbor himself and do not reveal anothers secret lest he who hears you bring shame upon you and your ill repute have no end

a word fitly spoken is like apples of #gold in a setting of silver

like a #gold ring or an ornament of gold is a wise reprover to a listening ear

like the cold of #snow in the time of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him he refreshes the soul of his masters

like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a #gift he does not give

with patience a ruler may be persuaded and a soft #tongue will break a bone

if you have found #honey eat only enough for you lest you have your fill of it and vomit it

let your foot be seldom in your neighbors #house lest he have his fill of you and hate you

a man who bears false witness against his #neighbor is like a war club or a sword or a sharp arrow

trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble is like a bad #tooth or a foot that slips

whoever sings songs to a heavy #heart is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day and like vinegar on soda

if your #enemy is hungry give him bread to eat and if he is thirsty give him water to drink for you will heap burning coals on his head and the lord will reward you

the north wind brings forth rain and a backbiting #tongue angry looks

it is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome #wife

like cold #water to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country

like a muddied spring or a polluted #fountain is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked

it is not good to eat much #honey nor is it glorious to seek ones own glory

a man without selfcontrol is like a #city broken into and left without walls

like #snow in summer or rain in harvest so honor is not fitting for a fool

like a sparrow in its flitting like a swallow in its flying a #curse that is causeless does not alight

a whip for the horse a bridle for the donkey and a #rod for the back of fools

answer not a #fool according to his folly lest you be like him yourself

answer a #fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own eyes

whoever sends a #message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence

like a lame mans legs which hang useless is a proverb in the #mouth of fools

like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives #honor to a fool

like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the #mouth of fools

like an archer who wounds everyone is one who hires a passing #fool or drunkard

like a dog that returns to his vomit is a #fool who repeats his folly

do you see a man who is wise in his own #eyes there is more hope for a fool than for him

as a door turns on its hinges so does a #sluggard on his bed

the #sluggard buries his hand in the dish it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth

the #sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly

whoever meddles in a #quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears

like a madman who throws firebrands arrows and #death is the man who deceives his neighbor and says i am only joking 

for lack of wood the #fire goes out and where there is no whisperer quarreling ceases

as charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire so is a quarrelsome man for kindling #strife

the #words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels they go down into the inner parts of the body

whoever hates disguises himself with his #lips and harbors deceit in his heart when he speaks graciously believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heart though his hatred be covered with deception his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly

whoever digs a #pit will fall into it and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling

a lying #tongue hates its victims and a flattering mouth works ruin

do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what a #day may bring

let another praise you and not your own mouth a stranger and not your own #lips

a #stone is heavy and sand is weighty but a fools provocation is heavier than both

#wrath is cruel anger is overwhelming but who can stand before jealousy 

better is open rebuke than hidden #love

faithful are the wounds of a #friend profuse are the kisses of an enemy

one who is full loathes #honey but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet

like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his #home

oil and perfume make the heart glad and the sweetness of a #friend comes from his earnest counsel

do not forsake your friend and your fathers friend and do not go to your brothers house in the day of your #calamity

be wise my #son and make my heart glad that i may answer him who reproaches me

the prudent sees danger and hides himself but the #simple go on and suffer for it

take a mans garment when he has put up #security for a stranger and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an adulteress

whoever blesses his #neighbor with a loud voice rising early in the morning will be counted as cursing

a continual dripping on a rainy day and a quarrelsome #wife are alike to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in ones right hand

#iron sharpens iron and one man sharpens another

whoever tends a fig #tree will eat its fruit and he who guards his master will be honored

as in #water face reflects face so the heart of man reflects the man

sheol and abaddon are never satisfied and never satisfied are the #eyes of man

the #crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold and a man is tested by his praise

crush a #fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain yet his folly will not depart from him

the wicked flee when no one pursues but the righteous are bold as a #lion

when a #land transgresses it has many rulers but with a man of understanding and knowledge its stability will long continue

a #poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food

those who forsake the law praise the #wicked but those who keep the law strive against them

evil men do not understand #justice but those who seek the lord understand it completely

better is a #poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways

the one who keeps the law is a #son with understanding but a companion of gluttons shames his father

whoever multiplies his #wealth by interest and profit gathers it for him who is generous to the poor

if one turns away his #ear from hearing the law even his prayer is an abomination

whoever misleads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own #pit but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance

a rich man is wise in his own #eyes but a poor man who has understanding will find him out

when the righteous triumph there is great glory but when the #wicked rise people hide themselves

whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain #mercy

blessed is the one who fears the lord always but whoever hardens his heart will fall into #calamity

like a roaring #lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people

a ruler who lacks #understanding is a cruel oppressor but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days

if one is burdened with the blood of another he will be a fugitive until #death let no one help him

whoever walks in #integrity will be delivered but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall

whoever works his land will have plenty of #bread but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty

a faithful man will abound with blessings but whoever hastens to be #rich will not go unpunished

to show partiality is not good but for a piece of #bread a man will do wrong

a stingy man hastens after #wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him

whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with his #tongue

whoever robs his #father or his mother and says that is no transgression is a companion to a man who destroys

a greedy man stirs up #strife but the one who trusts in the lord will be enriched

whoever trusts in his own mind is a #fool but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered

whoever gives to the poor will not want but he who hides his #eyes will get many a curse

when the #wicked rise people hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase

he who is often reproved yet stiffens his #neck will suddenly be broken beyond healing

when the #righteous increase the people rejoice but when the wicked rule the people groan

he who loves wisdom makes his #father glad but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth

by justice a #king builds up the land but he who exacts gifts tears it down

a man who flatters his #neighbor spreads a net for his feet

an evil man is ensnared in his transgression but a #righteous man sings and rejoices

a righteous man knows the rights of the #poor a wicked man does not understand such knowledge

scoffers set a city aflame but the wise turn away #wrath

if a wise man has an argument with a #fool the fool only rages and laughs and there is no quiet

bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless and seek the life of the #upright

a #fool gives full vent to his spirit but a wise man quietly holds it back

if a ruler listens to falsehood all his officials will be #wicked

the poor man and the oppressor meet together the lord gives light to the #eyes of both

if a #king faithfully judges the poor his throne will be established forever

the #rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother

when the wicked increase transgression increases but the #righteous will look upon their downfall

discipline your #son and he will give you rest he will give delight to your heart

where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint but blessed is he who keeps the #law

by mere words a #servant is not disciplined for though he understands he will not respond

do you see a man who is hasty in his words there is more #hope for a fool than for him

whoever pampers his #servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir

a man of wrath stirs up #strife and one given to anger causes much transgression

ones pride will bring him low but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain #honor

the partner of a thief hates his own #life he hears the curse but discloses nothing

the fear of man lays a #snare but whoever trusts in the lord is safe

many seek the face of a ruler but it is from the lord that a man gets #justice

an unjust man is an abomination to the #righteous but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked
